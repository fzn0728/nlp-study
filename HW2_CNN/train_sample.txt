( while the depiction is not biblically accurate , it is entertaining and might be excuse enough to familiarize ourselves with the true record by reading what is written in genesis 7 . )  a positive note is that the studio has avoided any segment which is as perversely dark as nihgt on bald mountain upon which the original film ended .  there are some images based upon fantasy such as the flying whales in respighi's pines of rome or images which have their roots in mythology such as the ethereal creatures which tell the story of nature's cycle of life , death , and rebirth in igor stravinsky's firebird suite .  but the stories they tell are uplifting , containing nothing too frightening for our younger children .  the darkest segment , spiritually speaking , actually belongs to the only holdover from the original fantasia , mickey mouse in the sorcerer's apprentice by paul dukas .  but overall , the emotions evoked from fantasia 2000 are positive ones , being full of hope and promise .  music has an impact which can be undeniably felt , capable of leading the listener to emotional peaks and inspirational highs simply not attainable through other mediums .  it is no wonder that the levites , as the priestly tribe of the old testament , were also the appointed musicians .  if fantasia 2000 is able to introduce a new audience to music which inspires and exalts , it will have done an incredible service .

pos	aggressive , bleak , and unrelenting film about an interracial couple , steve and sam ( damon jones and elexa williams respectively ) , who are viciously attacked in a parking garage one night by a gang of skinheads .  the skinheads beat steve , then force him to watch as they brutally rape his girlfriend over and over again .  when sam kills herself later that evening , steve decides that the skinheads must be taught a lesson .  waiting seven months for the thuggish skinheads to forget about the incident entirely , steve shaves his head , dresses in combat boots and suspenders , tattoos his flesh with nazi symbols , and tries to infiltrate the gang .  as he gets closer and closer to the people who committed the horrible crime against his girlfriend , he begins to learn just how vicious these people really are and starts to question his own motives for violence .  randolph kret's script , based on two real life incidents that affected not only his life but the life of the film's producer shaun hill , is an affront on violence and intolerance .  the film causes its audience to be subjected to such brutality and ignorance that one can't help but be disgusted by the events presented within .  i've seen it said that this is the film fight club should have been , but david fincher's film was trying to define a generation .  kret's film is a wake up call to a generation and his message is a powerful one .  if fincher is the kubrick of our generation , then kret is our d . w .  griffith ( thematically speaking ) .  there is not a single likable character in the film .  the skinheads are obviously the most repulsive characters in the film , not only because of their beliefs but because they are in a constant state of fury ( not just against other races but within their own circles ) .  the african-american characters in the film are constantly shown as sexually assaulting drug abusers who are always on a joyride looking for someone to accost .  even gay men get in on the act , locating the skinheads' lair and beating them severely with lead pipes and other blunt objects .  the main character steve is also unlikable because of the person he becomes just to seek out revenge .  what all of this comes down to is the simple message that violence begets violence , and the constant clashes between factions will do nothing but continue the endless cycle of violence inherent in our society .  the cast of this film is absolutely remarkable .  damon jones shows a raw energy that many actors can't seem to summon these days and his performance seems nothing less than powerful .  his initial reaction to hearing about his girlfriend's suicide is one of the most affecting scenes i have ever seen in a film .  david lee wilson , who plays ( appropriately enough ) david lee is accurately evil as the second in command skinhead who also makes extra money performing oral sex on other men ( an irony that seems lost on the other skinheads ) .  wilson's character is pure hatred and he brings out this hate perfectly .  sadly , actor dave ward , who portrays the character of crew , will not be able to follow up his excellent performance as he was the victim of a vicious act of violence himself at the hands of a fellow actor during an incident of road rage .  ward showed immense promise and he will be greatly missed .  note : it is a shame that the filmmakers had to add a disclaimer to the end of the film stating that neither they nor the musicians contributing music for the film condone racism .  the message about hatred couldn't be spelled out any more clearly than it is here , but there are those who would probably find this film much more akin to a training video than a condemnation .  there are no " winners " at the end of this film either .  no character gets his or her comeuppance and the ending leaves us almost right where we began .  where american history x had redemption for most of its characters , no such victories are in store for pariah's band of twisted souls .  it is this bleak ending that carries the film's most powerful message : the message that , despite what you may be able to momentarily do to put your own mind to rest , evil will still be with us ( and in many forms ) and there is very little than can be done to eradicate it entirely .

neg	roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast , " who would have guessed that the most savage mad-dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by . . .  ben kingsley ? "  my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark , henry fonda in once upon a time in the west , or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it .  they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild , sympathetic , or even ineffectual character roles .  the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious .  that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast .  gary " gal " dove ( played by ray winstone ) has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain .  life has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing .  but his paradise is about to be shattered by a one-two-punch .  the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa .  the second punch comes from gal's past .  back in london gang boss teddy bass ( ian mcshane , tv's lovejoy ) is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal .  he sends his most rabid henchman don logan ( ben kingsley ) to fetch gal .  don will accept any decision gal makes from " yes " to " certainly . "  however , if gal says " no " don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guy's ex-porn- star wife deedee ( amanda redman ) .  in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody's skin .  kingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness .  there are some serious problems in louis mellis's and david scinto's script that should have been caught before filming .  when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success .  beyond an ability to use skin-diving gear , no special talents are required of him .  any local hood could have done what gal is needed for .  additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault , flooding the vault .  no only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether , but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool .  in spite of the provocative title , the story is cliched and overly familiar .  i know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade .  the story is usually of the reformed outlaw , a robert taylor type , who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability .  the old gang , however , wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git ? im .  it is not a great plot .  in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards .  perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film .  it is an old plot dressed up to look new .  if the plot is old , at least the style is creative .  this is director jonathan glazer's first film , but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout .  his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences .  cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes .  we see one side of a person's faces .  but the other side fades into the darkness , a sort of metaphor for the half-world these characters in-habit .  half of everything that is happening is also kept hidden .  us yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog .  at least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking , the heavy accents , and the cockney language .  sexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre , the london crime film .  the plot may be new to british crime films , but it would be overly familiar as a western .  further respectability comes from ben kingsley's high-powered performance .  i give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .

pos	this is your standard musical comedy from the ' 30 's , with a big plus that it features some well known ' 30 's actors in small fun cameo 's . there is not much to the story and basically the movie is all about its fun and ' no - worries ' overall kind of atmosphere , with a typical hal roach comedy touch to it . appereantly it 's a ' cinderella story ' but i most certainly did n't thought of it that way while watching the movie . the story gets very muddled in into the storytelling , that features many different characters and also many small cameo appearance , when the main characters hit the hollywood studios . of course the highlight of the movie is when laurel & hardy make their appearance and show some of their routines . it 's like watching a movie and getting a laurel & hardy short with it for free . also laurel & hardy regular walter long makes an appearance in the routine and james finlayson ( without a mustache this time ) as the director of the short . it 's certainly true that all of the cameo 's and subplots distract from the main plot line and character but in this case that is no problem , since its all way more fun and interesting to watch than the main plot line and the shallow typical main character . the movie is most certainly not any worse than any of its other genre movies from the same time period , though the rating on here would suggest otherwise . 7/10

pos	john carpenter directed this stylish and gory vampire flick to which has it's good side and it's bad .  it's held up by some good performances and dazzling special effects leading up to an ending that's pretty satisfying .  james woods gives an outstanding performance that almost covers up the movie .  the good side : some neat scenes of vampires and violence .  the bad : no scares .  yes that's right , even though being directed by one of horror's most cherished directors , 'vampires' is the least bit scary , if not at all .  james woods stars as jack a vampire hunter out to stop the plans of the 'master' vampire valek played by thomas ian griffith whom wants vampires to walk in the daylight .  daniel baldwin plays his sidekick montoya , a wise-cracking guy who really isn't that funny .  in the opening scene jack along with montoya and the team of vampire hunters , find an abandoned house to which vampire occupy .  of course we all know sunshine kills vampires , and that is just how they kill these vampires : hooking them to ropes and dragging them outside letting them burn to death .  after throwing a party for what happened , the vampires that did not die come back to trash it .  they kill almost all of jack's team , leaving only a few alive .  sheryl lee plays a prostitute katrina who was bitten by valek , but not yet turned into a vampire .  she is rescued by jack and ? flees with them on their search for valek .  they have to fight they're way against vampires , leading up to a finale that is well-done with great special effects .  'vampires' definately could have been done better .  the make-up , special effects and story are first rate , but there is no scares or terror that the film could have had .  it to me had more humor than horror , almost being compared to 'fright night' with the mix of violence and comedy .  john carpenter does a great job of directing this film .  he eases through some tough times and saves the flaws , which are noticeable but forgettable .  the script is clever and funny , with many lines that make us laugh out loud .  i much enjoyed 'vampires' with a few exceptions .  it's one of those films you see but don't take to heart .  you enjoy the time you spent and go on .  the recently released 'psycho' is the same way , it's not as good as you'd hope but it is fun and entertaining .  'vampires' is a good horror flick with no scares but plenty of other content to please the viewer .

pos	seen may 19 , 1999 at 5 p . m . at the crossgates cinema 18 ( guilderland , n . y . ) , theater #1 , with my brother john for $8 . 50 .  [theater rating : * * * * : excellent seats , sound and picture]   ( critic's note : this review is the longest i've ever written and still only scratches the surface .  i'd recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as a form of critical analysis . )  as my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of `the phantom menace' - how do i even write this review ?  never mind the fact that i've been waiting for a new `star wars' movie since i was seven years old .  never mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before it was even released .  never mind that there's so much going on in this movie in terms of plot , action , special effects and long-term story that to analyze every aspect would take a lot of time and energy and still wouldn't cover everything .  and also like ted does in all of his reviews , i'll try to review this in a way different from my usual reviews and instead write as casually as possible as if i was talking directly to you , the reader .  before we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the film , many of the most general and most significant factors must be considered ( to get the specifics of the film , skip this and the next four paragraphs ) .  as has been made obvious for the last several years , another trilogy of films will be produced to account for the [missing] initial three installments of the `star wars' series ( the first of the films was actually episode four , not one ) .  george lucas , the creator of the series , has probably just assumed most people know the first-produced trilogy ( `star wars , ' `the empire strikes back' and `return of the jedi' ) is actually the second trilogy , chronologically .  in media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order , but i can't recall his reasons .  with this new film he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy ( err . . .  second trilogy . . .  well you know what i mean ) .  and in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which , unfortunately , may serve as spoilers so proceed with caution .  [critic's note #1 : it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because i would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed , but it would be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule .  critic's note #2 : reviewing this film also breaks the universal critics' law of reviewing movies , which as roger ebert coined , `it's not what a movie is about , but how it is about it . '  because so many outside factors come into play in the film's plot and significance as part of a trilogy , and just considering modern society , it again would be difficult , if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story . ]  first of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it .  we know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker , who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire .  we know obi-wan `ben' kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of `the force' in attempts to become a jedi knight , but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the `dark side . '  we also know something about `the force' itself , that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it ( the jedi ) .  what we don't know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy , which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth .  to me , this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle , definite order to all the complexity .  also , it seems that we're supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended .  most notably , details regarding the emperor from `empire' and `jedi , ' and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine .  for those who haven't kept up with all the `star wars' paraphernalia over the years , there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor ( or his voice at least ) .  with `the phantom menace' being the first chapter of a long saga , one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid , including the history behind all the major factors of the series , especially `the force' and the jedi knights .  unfortunately , this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained .  i didn't liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness .  if you're going to tell a story from the beginning - tell it from the beginning ( is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes -1 through -3 to clarify the back story even further ? ) .  but i digress .  i've said so much and yet i haven't even touched on the specifics of the film itself .  all these necessary `disclaiming' elements should go to show just how vast the story of the `star wars' series is and this individual film itself .  what we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three we've come to know and love since the late 1970s .  its similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar , but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality .  the basic story is rather sorted , complex and even confusing at times .  we're told that an army known as `the trade federation' has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo .  we're not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is , instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly .  we're introduced to two jedi , the master qui-gon jinn ( neeson ) and his apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( mcgregor ) .  the two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planet's queen , amidala ( portman ) .  the leader of the federation , an alien called viceroy , is following the orders of a strange , mythical character - an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wears .  he is referred to as lord sidious but considering his appearance , and especially that creepy evil voice of his , he is a obviously one of the most significant characters in the series .  sidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person .  clearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity ( which is never openly revealed in the film , but should be clear to most viewers .  i have a feeling we'll delve into his background in the next two films ) .  but it doesn't take the film long to spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the film's story begins to move along .  the film doesn't have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one mini-plot and adventure on top of another .  there are so many of these mini-plots-within-plots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook .  the other films have relied on this type of storytelling , but because of the limits of the technology at the time , the films' screenplays were also limiting .  the sense of limitlessness here is what gives `the phantom menace' its unique traits .  as we already know , the film takes place at least a generation or two before the original `star wars' trilogy which means a lot of the background which was unclear and/or unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story .  and here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of 10-year-old anakin skywalker ( lloyd ) , by qui-gon jinn and his introduction to the jedi council .  to briefly summarize the story , jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt to buy parts for queen amidala's spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation .  their meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force .  jinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force , and through another sub-plot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he will enter , more and more details of his significance begin to reveal themselves .  this also provides for a new elaboration and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before .  in fact , it seems to be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before .  the element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific which is completely unnecessary .  by the film's third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot .  it's funny how the reality of the `star wars' world seems so embedded in mythology , new age-like philosophy and religion and yet the solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been violence .  not that this technique hasn't been used in movies and in real-life situations countless times throughout history .  and at least it's all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in a fun and exciting matter .  it does border of the cartoonish sometimes , but that's just the film appealing to our inner child , which is the basic reason the entire saga exists and has become such a big part of our modern society .  `the phantom menace' delivers exactly what you'd expect from a `star wars' film which is why it succeeds as well as it does but is always why it never truly achieves greatness .  so many things in the film we've seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just a bit more on story and character because they were limited .  but this film is far from bad because it at least embraces the spirit of sheer fun at the movies .  
neg	it's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show . 
pos	a lot of people do n't think branagh 's hamlet film is all that good , but i must admit i think it is splendid . like virtually every production of shakespeare , it has problems and it has had to make hard choices , not all of which work out . the thing about the " secret doors everywhere " , for instance , simply does n't work . that element never achieves the ominous feeling of metaphor or analogy that it attempts to , which results in the play being too gaudy and losing its trademark sense of a thousand mysteries looming . this is the biggest problem with this production . and while it 's a biggie , i 'm also inclined to say that it 's the only problem . almost everything else works out absolutely beautifully . all right , so branagh is a mite too old for the title role . and the relationship with ophelia seems a little forced . and he gets too hysterical at times . but that 's it . no other complaints . even with these faults , i think this version is a seminal one , and if it 's not as powerful a drama as it ought to be , it 's every bit the literary work that it equally ought to be . we get the complete text of the longest version of the play , innovatively and expensively brought to the screen , mostly enunciated in perfect and modern and highly understandable voices - even if they sometimes speak too quickly in order to get the massive text over with . but in a staging of shakespeare , it simply is not possible to speak slowly enough for the audience to really appreciate the full depths of the language . for that , one must delve into the print versions of the plays . all the actors of this version are simply mesmerizing and utterly and instantly classic ( incl . jack lemmon ) . julie christie as gertrude is surely one of the best ever , and even the american actors are astounding , esp . charlton heston as the player king - who would have thought it ? ! ( a story is going around that heston once played hamlet on stage , and when a critic in the front row could n't stand his hammy acting and said out loud , " this is terrible ! " , heston reportedly retorted right from the stage : " well , i did n't write this crap ! " of course it may not be true , but it 's a funny story - and if true , a bold and ironic choice for branagh to include heston here . ) robin williams as " young ozric " is perhaps not young enough for the part , but he makes it a comical one , which is warranted . overall it is a very well - produced version , with most of the key scenes being , to my mind , supremely memorable . of course , i watched this movie just as i was becoming interested in shakespeare ( and around the same time as luhrmann 's formidable romeo+juliet ) , and it made a great impression on me , which must account for some of my fondness for it . all things considered , i must pronounce branagh 's hamlet to be my favorite one , with derek jacobi 's 1980 bbc version a close second . i probably like branagh 's shakespeare work more than most , finding him an expert interpreter and popularizer , with an attractively casual attitude to the words and a deep and appropriately and unashamedly enthusiastic appreciation of the text . in the world of shakespeare acting , the two brightest luminaries remain olivier and branagh , and while olivier is the superior actor , branagh brings shakespeare down from the pedestal of snobbery and artifice , and transforms it into churlish , easy - going , populistic worldliness while compromising none of its dignity . branagh , i believe , brings out a truer shakespeare than the world has yet seen . and so , 10 out of 10 for an absolutely tremendous hamlet .

neg	when i ponder childhood memories past , one of the things that always springs immediately to mind is watching the " inspector gadget " tv show with my older brother .  truth be told , we were rabid fanatics ; our version of cowboys and indians was chasing each other around our coffee table to the theme tune , alternating who would get to be gadget and who would be stuck playing the part of dr . claw , the inspector's arch nemesis .  i was never a biggie on nostalgia , but you just can't help but have fond memories of something like that .  sometimes i even find myself up at 4am watching re-runs of my favorite episodes , trying to recapture some of that sense of wonder i felt as a kid .  at the very least , i was expecting the new film version of the classic television series to have at least some kind of similar effect on me .  despite how horrid a film may be , the simple task of rekindling even a slight feeling of nostalgia is pretty tough to screw up .  so back i sat , with minimum expectations of what the movie would deliver ( let's face it ; exactly how good can a live-action disney film really be ? ) .  i was wise enough to steer clear from the likes of mr . magoo and george of the jungle ( two previous disney adaptations ) , and i wish to god that i had been sharp enough to skip gadget as well .  rarely has a movie left me with such an utter feeling of emptiness .  as everyone else was getting up to exit the screening room after the movie had completed its assault on mankind , i was left sitting there , absolutely speechless and totally dumbfounded at what i had just seen .  can something this awful truly exist in such an evolved world ?  right from the beginning , i knew i was in trouble .  in the opening scenes , each character is introduced as if their sole purpose is to just be , to simply serve as real-life duplicates of their cartoon clones .  when referring to them , people almost yell in fear that the audience will not catch on as to who a certain character is supposed to be ( " oh , hi penny !  is brain with you ? " ) .  creating one-dimensional replicas is one thing ; having mere names take the place of them is quite another .  the " plot " , shall we call it , stays fairly in tune with the original series .  matthew broderick stars as john brown ( how creative is that ? ) ,  a security guard who is horribly injured by a pack of ruthless businessmen headed by scolex ( why , rupert everett , for the love of god why ? ? ? ! ! ! ) , who himself is transformed into claw by an unfortunate chain of events .  brown is then rescued and used as a prototype for a new law-enforcement technology wherein he's joined with various machine parts and some nifty gadgets to form ( drumroll , please ) . . .  inspector gadget !  >from here on out , the movie becomes a hodgepodge of stupid dialog and confusing situations ( although , to be fair , my confusion could have been caused by the virtual concussion the film was inflicting upon my fragile mind ) .  there's something about an evil gadget taking over the city ( his first crime must have been swiping matt dillon's dentures from there's something about mary ) and it all ends with ( what else ? ) a bunch of post-credit nonsense and a cameo by don adams himself .  to be honest , i wasn't much paying attention to these " treats " .  i was just glad that it was over .

neg	 " party camp , " is one of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies i've seen in awhile .  a late rip-off of the " meatballs " series , the film follows a group of young camp counselors at camp chipmunk .  that's really about all that can be said about the " plot " because nothing much happens , except that the main character , wise-cracking jerry ( andrew ross ) , has the hots for a cute blonde ( kerry brennan ) , and there is a big contest in the climax .  how fun !  since , " party camp , " has practically no screenplay and there is no talent at all involved , the least the makers could have done was make it raunchy and exploitative .  it's not that i think exploitation is necessarily a good quality , but when you are talking about a dull turkey like this , the least that could have been done would be to fill it with a lot of mindless sex .  even a psychopathic slasher at the camp would have done the trick .  at least , then , it wouldn't have been such a chore to sit through .  never before have i seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat .  the comedy was easy to spot , but it wasn't the least bit funny .  it was groan-inducing .  constantly throghout , i was asking myself if director gary graver actually thought this movie was worth anything .  so what saves , " party camp , " from the dreaded zero star rating ?  well , that's simple : jewel shepard , as a flighty bimbo , was admittedly fun to watch .  although nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depths of motion picture trash , at least if the film had centered on shepard , she might have been able to add a little spice to an otherwise rancid , low-budget teen comedy .

pos	'contact' shows why jodie foster is one of our best actresses .  see contact with your family .  it is a movie for all ages .  --a review by stuart cracraft  contact starring : jodie foster , matthew mcconaughey , john hurt director : robert zemeckis star  after a predictable mit phillip morrison powers-of-10 zoom-out start ( which can be surprising to those not familiar with prof . morrison's work ) , contact picks up steam , gradually , building , by-the-end , an irresistable juggernaut and a very good movie that does not as is so often the case fall out-of-balance in terms of too much pandering to the technological " geek " side .  by the end , the audience is left with what good science fiction is supposed to do : evoke a sense of wonder about the universe and evoke questions in your mind about what's out there .  this movie does not let technology overshadow characterization and in this sense it is unusual amongst high-tech movies .  however , except for jodie foster ( elie arroway ) and john hurt ( s . r .  hadden ) , who are both actors of exceptional caliber , the supporting cast are not especially impressive .  hurt certainly has had better roles ( stephen ward in scandal ) .  this one , as the multi-billionare hadden , does not do his acting skills justice .  this is clearly a foster movie by one of the great hollywood lights of our generation .  foster's radiance has never been more strong than in the scene where she finally meets the vegans on their terms .  early scenes take a long , long time to build up to this .  the movie's pacing is very good and subtle .  the panoramas of the radio dishes at arecibo and ceti in new mexico and puerto rico are beautiful .  the politics of foster's character attempting to obtain funding for research at these places are trite and predictable however .  one of the most entertaining , but very short scenes , is when foster is confronted by rob lowe , during a cabinet-level presidential meeting to discuss the alien invitation .  there were real sparks in this scene between foster and lowe and it would behoove them to consider other vehicles in which this dynamism could be explored .  it is the only scene in the movie in which there were tremendous dynamics between two characters .  everything else was very one-sided ( e . g .  foster ) .  lowe can stand up to foster and it showed in that scene at the cabinet table .  the core scene of the movie is set on a surrealistic beach on a far-away world in the starsystem of vega .  it feels a lot like science fiction writer john varley's scenes in his book steel beach , where the female protagonists encounters an immensely superior intelligence , in one case a computer manufactured by mankind itself , and in foster's case , an illusion drawn from her memory .  in another sense , this immensely moving scene evokes gene roddenberry's star trek pilot the cage , later the menagerie , when jeffrey hunter and susan oliver have their memories manipulated to create new worlds in which they live and encounter aliens .  the concept is not new , by any sense , in the world of science fiction .  but the beach scene , which is the centerpiece of the film , as is the whole film , is driven by foster .  freed from her needs to direct by director zemecki , foster is able to let it all hang out in the characterization and the lead she provides to her supporting cast .  as the movie gains speed , foster's acting intensifies and the audience really does experience it with her .  it is certainly oscar-caliber acting , unquestionably .  the supporting cast does well and zemeckis throws in some humor with some president clinton cameos , cleverly manipulated , george stephanopolus-style , to seem very forrest gump .  in fact , zemeckis et .  al .  got in trouble for the usage of some of the footage seen in the movie , vis a vis clinton .  but the audience i attended this movie with just had some good chuckles at clinton's walk-ons .  the much-discussed tension between science and religion in this movie is not particularly insightful to those who have already gone through this course though it is helpful to those in the audience who have not .  also , the near-final scene , in a senate judiciary hearing room is disappointing .  contact is a fitting memorial to the memory of carl sagan , science popularizer , and sometime pedantic gadfly of the halls of academe .  perhaps now , sagan can be said to be with his dragons of eden .

pos	time paradoxes are the devil 's snare for underemployed minds . they 're fun to consider in a ' what if ? ' sort of way . film makers and authors have dealt with this time and again in a host of films and television including ' star trek : first contact ' , the ' back to the future ' trilogy , ' bill and ted 's excellent adventure ' , ' groundhog day ' and the stargate sg1 homage , ' window of opportunity ' . heinlein 's ' all you zombies ' was written decades ago and yet it will still spin out people reading that short story for the first time . in the case of terry gilliam 's excellent film , ' 12 monkeys ' , it 's hard to establish what may be continuity problems versus plot elements intended to make us re - think our conception of the film . repeated viewings will drive us to different conclusions if we retain an open mind . some , seeing the film for the first time , will regard cole , played by bruce willis , as a schizophrenic . most will see cole as a man disturbed by what adams describes as ' the continual wrenching of experience ' visited upon him by time travel . unlike other time travel stories , ' 12 monkeys ' is unclear as to whether future history can be changed by manipulating events in the past . cole tells his psychiatrist , railly ( madeleine stowe ) , that time can not be changed , but a phone call he makes from the airport is intercepted by scientists after he has been sent back to 1996 , in his own personal time - line . even this could be construed as an event that had to happen in a single time - line universe , in order to ensure that the time - line is not altered ... cole has to die before the eyes of his younger self for fate to be realized . if that 's the case , time is like a fluid , it always finds its own level or path , irrespective of the external forces working on it . it boggles the mind to dwell on this sort of thing too much . if you can change future events that then guide the actions of those with the power to send people back in time , as we see on board the plane at the end of the film , then that means the future can be changed by manipulating past events ... or does it ? the film has probably led to plenty of drunken brawls at bars frequented by physicists and mathematicians

pos	virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre .  since 'dark city' ( 1998 ) , films about alternative universes and parallel worlds have been coming one after another .  the most popular and original of them all has been the matrix .  all the films released after it , have been less successful .  david cronenberg's existenz , released only a couple of months after the matrix , was accepted and even appreciated ( by some ) , but the hype was gone .  and when 'the thirteenth floor' aired this fall , it was completely overseen and ignored .  i admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying , feeling like eating the same meal over and over again .  it was therefore i was less than excited , when i went out to see to 'the thirteenth floor' .  however , i was positively surprised by josef rusnak's latest picture .  matrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality , combining the best of hollywood's action and effects with an intelligent story .  existenz was a violent , gory and unsettling journey through reality and virtual reality , ending in blood and madness .  'the thirteenth floor' is somewhere in between .  instead of going after the crowds - the action audience ( like the matrix ) , or aiming at the horror fans ( like existenz ) , 'the thirteenth floor' presents a more intelligent plot , witch will provide a less entertaining and more serious experience , that the true science fiction lovers will find rewarding .  in a near future . . . on  the thirteenth floor of a classified building , a genius scientist , hannon fuller , has created a simulated world , his personal dreamworld , where every inhabitant is a complex , selflearning program that only believes it is real .  right after the first testing of this world , fuller ( ) is found murdered .  douglas hall ( ) , his closest friend and business partner , immediately becomes the prime suspect and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth .  a beautiful woman ( gretchen mol ) who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mystery , which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence .  the first " download into simulation " is impressive .  it is the creator's first visit to his world , his creation .  in order to enter this virtual universe , you have to take over someone's identity , become another person .  this is called conciseness transfer , and this is part of the tragedy in the film : people " wake up " in unknown places and strange things start happen .  they start to doubt in their own sanity .  these innocent people pay for the mistakes of their " users " and creators with their sanity and their lives .  it is a frightening reality ; the fact that all the people in the simulation ( the program links ) are living out their lives , oblivious , not knowing that they are puppets in someone's fantasy .  with an appealing ( " blade runner " - type ) of detective story , this film presents the beauty and possibilities of virtual reality and the lurking danger that is always present .  our modern world is metal and glass -- cold , unfriendly , impersonal .  the thirties are different -- colorful , beautiful , elegant , virile .  this contrast demonstrates a wish for change .  virtual reality is here portrayed as a magical , enchanting power that seduces you into its endless possibilities .  to some it is just a journey to their personal paradise , to some a personal playground -- a life without any consequences .  for others - a way to start over and " correct " their mistakes , by living in an illusion of their past .  virtual reality is a wizard that transforms your hopes , dreams and fantasies to life .  at least that's how it is all beginning .  but when you're waking up from your dream , the real world seems worthless and unreal and all you can think off is returning to your personal paradise .  this , almost narcotic effect , soon turns into confusion and ultimately madness .  some important and interesting philosophical questions are raised -- what is real ?  what is thought ?  who are we ?  if these were answered , this film would be the greatest science fiction ever made .  they are off course not answered , but posed in an intelligent manner .  the visual aspect of the film is one of the key elements , since it portrays the contrast between these computer-simulated universes .  kirk m . petrucelli has done a marvelous job with the recreation of the thirties with its glamour , grace and color ; and setting this world in opposition to our own -- an almost caricatured recreation of the nineties .  there are some honest and decent performances by an almost unknown cast and harald klose's moody musical score that is at in right place at the right time .  a rather unusual thing about'the thirteenth floor' is the almost complete lack of special effects .  there are no cgi animated creatures , no bullets in slow motion .  this is a more philosophical approach , reminding about the european way of filmmaking .  this is off course a major disappointment to the audience that is used to endless gunfights and mutated amphibians , but the more serious science fiction buffs and 'dark city'-fans will be pleased .  this film is interesting and inspiring .  it has everything existenz doesn't , but it lacks the immediacy and intensity of the matrix .  and then there is a happy end which , like in 'dark city' , completely alienates it from the rest of the story and context .  the plot itself is not as original as the filmmakers want us to think , since they have virtually sucked out all information from the best science fiction classics , including blade runner and 'dark city' .  with this in mind , 'the thirteenth floor' doesn't make an oscar candidate or a film that will be remembered a year from now , yet this is a beautiful , elegant and intelligent take on virtual reality .  
neg	of course i knew this going in .  why is it that whenever a tv-star makes a movie it's always a romantic comedy , and then they say on entertainment tonight or something , that they were " attracted to the characters .  they were really original . "  original ? ! let me give you a run-through of picture perfect : character a ) kate ( jennifer aniston , from tv's friends ) , a smart , beautiful , professional woman wants two things she can't have : a new job-title and the love of her co-worker kevin bacon .  her boss will only give her the job if she gets married and gets a mortgage and gets a lease on a german sportscar , and kevin bacon pnly sleeps with married or involved girls .  what does she do ?  she invents a fiance !  then when everyone wants to meet him , she tells some poor schmoe she met at a wedding that she will pay him $1000 to pretend to be in love with her for a company dinner , and pick a fight with her at the end , thus breaking the engagement but still being able to keep her job , since the guy ends up looking like a jerk and she is the poor , defenceless female .  he , of course , goes along with it .  gee , i wonder if they get together in the end .  i've seen more original stuff on the wb .  and better stuff too .  picture perfect also makes the mistake of being _wayyyyy_ too long at 100 minutes , and expecting us to like aniston's character , who comes off as a cold , spoiled bitch .

"   ( oh yeah , the day a newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me )  now , onto more serious stuff ( and with this film , i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way ) .  wild things has single-handedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa .  i'm not saying that in a bad way , but when you see this film , you may be shocked by what you see .  however , perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the film's charming cast and tricky plot , that they let the film slide with an r rating .  being mormon , i'm bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film .  trouble is , i have already seen it .  and i like it !  wild things is a film noir of the 90s , filled with 40s sensibilities , and yet breaking the rules and modern-day taboos of 90s culture .  the style in which it is filmed is rich in color .  the actors are all gorgeous people , seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film .  sure , it's all too good to be true , but ain't it fun to watch ?  when movies like this come along ( sort of a better version of basic instinct ) there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it .  there will be people who don't want to admit liking what they see , but i tell you , most anyone who sees this will like it .  wild things begins at blue bay high school , the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into .  it's almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance ( totally based on looks alone ) .  of course , there are those select few who may look slightly ugly , but compared to the average person , they are gorgeous .  immediately , the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time .  we can turn off our brains , right ?  wrong .  while you may be expecting one thing to happen , it certainly doesn't turn out that way .  the film begins in a classroom , with nearly all the main characters present .  there's sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a counselor for the students .  he's heading the class discussion .  there's also kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam .  teaching the class , however , are two policemen : ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) , who want to talk about 'sex . . .   ( cheers ) crimes ( boos ) ' .   " what is a sex crime ? "  ray asks .   " not gettin' any ! "  one student responds .  this pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch .  however , upon hearing this , one student , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , stands up and leaves the room , commenting that they can both kiss part of her body .  and so , wild things sets into motion .  quickly , kelly begins hitting on sam , but sam doesn't want anything to do with her advances .  kelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him .  she even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep .  surprisingly , that's really all i can tell you about the plot .  any more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists .  and what's more , these plot twists are actually unpredictable .  going along the way of scream , wild things maintains that film's surprises , and then adds even more to them .  there are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen .  and even though you think you may get tired of them , the surprises are so genuine that it's rather pleasing .  going back over them in my mind , nearly all of them work , though some stretch the boundaries of belief .  thankfully , the convoluted plot doesn't give us much time to think about each one , pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off .  as for the critics who complain that the film is trashy--well , it is .  this is pretty much just one trashy film .  however , it is the kind of trashy that isn't hard to watch .  it's good trash , in a sense .  one , the screenplay knows that it's not to be taken seriously , and it includes a lot of humor and satire into the story .  this varies everywhere from kelly's mother ( theresa russell ) , who is more of a caricature of rich people , all the way to an ambulance-chasing lawyer ( bill murray ) , who wears a neck-brace to cover an insurance scam he is running .  bill murray also provides the best character in the film , and most of the genuine laughs .  and two , the sex is more than gratuitous , although not unwelcomed .  wild things is supposed to have sex in it ( what film with that title wouldn't ? ) , and this movie breaks the boundaries .  instead of having heterosexual sex scenes , it also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell ( don't worry . . .  it's not as graphic as you might think ) .  the heterosexual scenes are quite graphic , but the surprise shocker is kevin bacon's full-frontal nude scene .  it's very brief , so if you blink , you may miss ( ahem ) it .  and , for as long as i can remember , i don't think i have seen an r-rated film show an erect one before ( it's not completely , but judging from the audiences' reaction , it was more than they expected too ) .  also , during one scene late in the film , there seemed to be a relationship brewing between bacon and dillon's characters , but nothing came of it ( makes you wonder if the director had to cut it in order for the r rating , or if the actors refused to do it ) .  what first made me want to see wild things was its cast .  neve campbell , of course , has been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released .  here , however , she turns every typical role she has done on its head and plays a gothic pothead .  the closest role to this was her performance in the craft ( though even in that she was a nice girl ) .  campbell is probably the best in the film and shows her wide range of talent .  you can tell she will be around for a long time .  denise richards will also be around for a long time , although she may be limited to the roles without much range .  here , she gets to express more emotions than in her stiff ( yet effective ) performance in starship troopers .  hopefully one day she will land a very good role that can display her ability .  and then there is daphne rubin-vega , a newcomer to the movies .  she gives a very good performance , although her character is mostly left to the background for the first hour and a half .  towards the end she does get a bigger part .  on the male side , matt dillon is probably the best , giving a subtle performance that surprises with every twist .  kevin bacon has a slightly wooden character , but he makes the most of it .  you must have admiration , though , for what he did on screen .  and judging from many of the women's reactions in the theater to that shot , they have grown a deeper appreciation for bacon ( yeah , right ) .  and then there is bill murray .  his performance is the comic relief , and he nearly steals the film .  as a whole , the entire cast works wondrously together , and they seem at home , even when doing the menage a troi .  director john mcnaughton , who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry : portrait of a serial killer , has constructed a wonderfully twisty plot that works .  his direction is smooth and stylish .  the visuals are striking , filled with rich colors , and almost so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air .  however , he seems more at home when the actors aren't talking .  his fly-by shots of the swampy areas are brilliant , and his photography of denise richards' climbing out of the pool is a highlight .  the cinematography is gorgeous in its details . its not often that you see a film like this , and we should watch it just to see how the camera can take pictures .  then , there is the music .  this was probably the most obvious thing to me , as it set the perfect mood for the film .  it's hard to describe in words , so just see the film and listen to it .  it's wonderfully composed and presented .  and be sure to stick around during the closing credits !  mcnaughton has finally put the ending credits to good use ( while most comedies use it for outtakes ) .  he has included some small scenes which help explain the preceding events .  some may say that these are lame attempts to explain the convoluted plot , but it's an entertaining way to finish the film .  plus , there are some shocking moments in these ending credits which just add to the fun .  wild things is appropriately rated r for strong sexuality , nudity , language and violence .  again , the nudity is rather unnecessary , but let's face it--people want to see it .  so why not give it to them ?  neve campbell , admirably , has a no-nudity clause in her contract , and the most you see of her is from behind as she takes her top off ( way to go , neve ! ) .  the sex scenes are graphic , especially the first one we see , between the mother and one of her deck hands .  one almost wonders how they got away with the r rating .  the language is quite harsh too , ranging from sexual innuendo to your average , everyday profanity .  and i can't stress it enough : don't allow kids under 18 to see this film .  the target age for the movie is the 18-24 range , and that's who should see it .  it's definitely not for those under 18 !  did i mention that this film is rated r ? however , for those that do get a chance to watch it , you will probably more likely be pleased , and may even take friends to see it the next time .

pos	anna and the king strides onto the screen in full regalia , wearing a brilliant suit of sumptuous landscapes , deep , vibrant colors and an epic storyline .  it's true beauty comes from it's subtle ruminations on the politics of power , whether it's between governments , or the interplay between a man and a woman .  anna ( jodie foster ) is a widowed british schoolteacher with a touch of wanderlust trying to grasp her quicksilver feelings concerning the recent death of her husband .  with son in tow , she takes the employ of king mongkut ( chow yun-fat ) to tutor his son in the english language .  mongkut sees the strength of the british and correctly surmises that his country's future lies in opening itself up to the ways of the western world .  anna function is to help provide that link .  the core of the film , of course , deals with the blossoming love between anna and mongkut as it attempts to germinate in the unfriendly soil of a shifting political climate .  foster plays anna with equal parts clenched jaw and wide-eyed wonder .  she is assertive , yet , respectful of the king as she initially tries to impose her western sensibilities upon him .  it is one of foster's strongest performances since silence of the lambs in a role she could not have played earlier in her career .  she brings a mature self- awareness and determination that might not have come across from a younger foster .  it's a joy to watch her cagily bargain for her own measure of influence within the realm of mongkut's monarchy .  when she makes her entrance into a politically charged banquet mid-film , she exudes a hypnotic beauty that is deepened by her textured performance .  chow-yun fat's king mongkut is every measure of foster's anna , perhaps even more so .  this is the chow yun-fat that hong kong cinema has been in love with for nearly twenty years .  he is imposing , yet vulnerable , playful , but stern .  it is an impressively assured and nuanced performance .  precious time is stolen from the movie's 155 minutes running time by an unengaging subplot involving one the king's concubines ( bai ling ) and her love of a commoner .  it strikes with the subtlety of siam's fabled white elephant as it stomps through the leisurely paced story .  some may be put off by the action filled climax of the movie .  although a bit inconsistent in tone from the rest of the film , it fits within the established subplot of a perceived siege by neighboring burma , a country backed by the british .  anna and the king transcends being a predictable , traditional love story by avoiding mawkishness .  it shows a seduction of intelligence .  ever mindful of each other's positions , anna and king mongkut negotiate a maze of social customs , conflicting world views and lost loved ones to connect on a level that ultimately proves deeply satisfying , if not achingly bittersweet .

neg	i'm not sure these words have ever been together in the same sentence : this erotic cannibal movie is boring . 
neg	it's time to take cover .  after a hiatus of about fifteen years , the disaster movie has come back with renewed zest .  in early 1997 , there were no less than three movies about volcanoes alone , one on television and two in the theaters , with dante's peak and volcano in heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar .  of the two , i had heard that dante's peak was the better film , so i decided to check it out when it was released on video .  the film begins with a slow motion scene of people in a third world country trying to evacuate their little town .  the town is being covered in ash and sulfuric water from what we presume is a volcanic eruption .  flaming rocks of various sizes also fall from the sky , crushing homes and people .  we see people panicking , people crying , and even horses rearing .  it is a disaster of biblical proportions , signified to us by one person dragging a cross down a road .  symbolism doesn't get much more blatant than that .  we learn that harry dalton ( pierce brosnan ) , a volcanologist with the u . s . geological survey , was there with his wife when the eruption occurred .  harry survived , but his wife did not .  a few years later , harry is sent to investigate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of dante's peak , washington ( which , we are told , has been voted second most desirable place to live ( under 20 , 000 ) by the readers of money magazine ) .  there harry meets rachel wando , a single mother of two who serves as mayor of dante's peak and proprietor of a small coffee shop .  although the mayor doesn't seem to be alarmed by the presence of a man sent to determine if the mountain next to their town is going to blow up , a few members of the city council are .  they are afraid that harry's presence is going to scare off an investor who has pledged to put millions of dollars into developing dante's peak .  they would rather have any news of possible stirrings within the neighboring dormant volcano swept under the rug .  however , when an amorous young couple takes a skinny-dip in the local hot springs , they turn up cooked by lava which bubbles up from a small fissure underneath .  thus begins a chain of events leading up to the inevitable eruption .  this film contains a number of cliches .  the amorous couple is one .  as soon as they doff their clothes , you know they're going to die .  the town busybody and the abrasive mother-in-law make appearances , as does the death-defying dog .  countless familiar scenarios only serve to make this film very predictable .  watching the movie , i was able to not only anticipate each of the major plot elements , but some of the dialogue as well .  unfortunate , since much of the dialog is terrible .  for example , harry's boss , paul ( charles hallahan ) , and a team from the u . s . geological survey join harry to assess the situation .  paul basically tells the townsfolk that harry's eruption predictions aren't cause for alarm .  this causes harry to leave in a fit of rage , only to turn up the next day , ready for work .  when paul asks harry why he stayed , he says with grim determination , " cause this town's in trouble and i'm the best man you've got . "  even better is when harry is trying to explain the need to jolt the residents into leaving .  he likens the situation to how a frog will jump out if dropped into a pot of boiling water .  if the frog is in cold water which is gradually heated up , however , the frog won't move and will allow itself to be cooked .   " is that your recipe for frog soup ? "  asks one of the team members .   " it's my recipe for disaster , " responds harry .  dante's peak has a singular talent for pointing out the obvious .  our heroes are in a boat in the middle of a lake which harry realizes the volcanic activity has turned to acid .  mayor wando demonstrates her brilliant powers of deduction by proclaiming , in a very grave tone , " acid eats metal . "  thanks for the tip .  when we first see the u . s . geological survey building , there's a caption labeling it as such .  this wouldn't have been so bad if it weren't for the fact that the caption is right above a sign on the building which reads , in large letters , " u . s . geological survey . "  i suppose the caption is for people who can't read signs .  although harry and mayor wando become an item by the end of the film , the viewer has no idea why .  there is a severe lack of chemistry between the two characters , and the relationship seems rushed because of this .  when they get close to kissing , i was asking myself , " why do they want to kiss ?  were they even attracted to each other ? "  if i were the mayor , i would sure think twice about kissing a guy who doesn't even crack a smile through the whole movie , trying to pull off the rough-yet-debonair act .  who does he think he is ?  james bond ?  the eruption of the volcano feels similarly rushed .  there are several " warning signs " prior to the eruption itself , but they are so lackluster and without suspense that we don't feel as if they are leading up to anything .  for example , one of the survey team members makes his way down into the crater of the volcano in order to retrieve a remote controlled robot .  a tremor occurs .  does he plunge headlong to his death ?  is he engulfed in lava which shoots up from below ?  no , a couple of rocks fall on him and break his leg .  the sole purpose of this scene seemed to be to set up the subsequent chopper rescue scene , which i suppose was intended to be dramatic as well .  it wasn't .  one plot thread left noticeably hanging was the investment in the town of dante's peak .  in a disaster movie , there's usually one guy who's greedy enough to cover up the possibility of eruption/fire/earthquake/explosion/tsunami/tornado/meteorite , and usually gets killed by the disaster .  it's okay , of course , because we all think he got what he deserved .  if you're going to be unoriginal , you might as well go all the way .  in dante's peak , the city councilmembers are concerned , but they don't really try hard enough .  maybe the mayor's abrasive mother-in-law should have been the one .  for no apparent reason , she snaps at harry for even positing that the volcano could erupt .  perhaps her ancestors invested in some pompeii real estate .  there are a couple of good things about this movie .  the first is the scenery .  there are panoramic shots of forests , lakes and mountains that are absolutely beautiful .  the second is the special effects .  they are the closest i've ever seen to a real pyroclastic eruption .  but when elements which don't speak are going to be the best parts of your movie , you'd probably better rewrite the script .

pos	warning : this review contains some spoilers for the 1964 film " fail-safe . "  if you haven't seen the film yet , proceed with caution .  nutshell : a relevant , intelligent , suspenseful drama .  still powerful today , even after the end of the cold war .  -------------------- " fail-safe " ( usa , 1964 ) drama , 111 minutes  screenplay by walter bernstein based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler produced by max e . youngstein directed by sidney lumet  review by jamahl epsicokhan --------------------  the most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it doesn't have a winning side and a losing side .  in a nuclear confrontation , everybody loses , and the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire world--assuming the world survives .  the idea--and perhaps the only real option--is to avoid war at all costs .  this is the theme of sidney lumet's " fail-safe , " a fictional drama based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler .   " fail-safe " takes place during the heart of the cold war ( the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis ) , when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in a single word : communism .  the premise centers around a combination of accidents and operation flaws .  five u . s . bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america .  the unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner , but a mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers .  suddenly out of contact , and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new directives , the bomber pilots cannot be recalled , and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike .  a great deal of " fail-safe " 's plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u . s . bombers from reaching russia's borders--at any cost .  the plot is compelling , and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios .  the reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails .  general bogan ( frank overton ) , taking orders directly from the president of the united states himself ( henry fonda ) , is powerless--the fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated , pre-programmed system that may not be stoppable , simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in their task to make a no-win situation winnable .  the events in " fail-safe " are fascinating because they're anything but predictable , but the real reason " fail-safe " works is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of its plot .  a key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war , communism , the cold war , and the united states' role in all of it .  most of this is through the film's use of the character groeteschele ( walter matthau ) , an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who , incidentally , is on the president's advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war .  many of the film's most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices .  early in the film , he hosts a dinner party where he explains the importance of " strategy " in a nuclear assault to " minimize " casualties .   " what's the difference between 60 million and 100 million dead ? "  a guest asks impatiently .   " forty million , " groeteschele responds wryly .  the problem with groeteschele's mindset is that he * believes * nuclear combat to be a viable method of war .  the only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals .  groeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over .  yet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off , as general black ( dan o'herlihy ) has often recommended .  on the contrary--according to groeteschele , that would lead to russia having * more * nuclear weapons than the u . s . , which would clearly put america at a disadvantage .  such a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race .   " fail-safe " clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war , and , likewise , it becomes a central theme in the film .  why continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over ?  is it wise ?  is it even logical ?  no , not really .  although " fail-safe " is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism , there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial , one-sided sort of way .  again , this is achieved through groeteschele , who is easily the film's most important character in terms of the larger-theme significance .  in addition to providing the central " pro-nuclear war " voice that the film warns against , he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism .  the context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib .  one of groeteschele's " logical " trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it's merely absurd .  he labels the average marxist an " unfeeling , calculating machine " that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself .  groeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u . s . drops the warhead on moscow , the soviets will * instantly * surrender , for to retaliate would invite counter-measures that would further destroy russia's home soil--which must be preserved at all costs .  groeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions ; general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revenge--as any normal person would .  the irony here is groeteschele's own mechanical theorizing .  he is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesn't even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns .  once the film makes it evident that turning the u . s . bombers will be impossible , the question becomes what the * consequences * of destroying moscow will be .  just how will the soviet union's leader react , and what can the president do to convey his best intentions ?   ( just * how * does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an * mishap * ? )  with the help of his translator buck ( larry hagman ) , the president negotiates at length with the soviet leader , in scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their simplicity , with lumet's long takes of fonda and hagman in the same frame , exchanging the dialog between the president and the soviet leader .  without getting into too much detail , i will say that the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly , yet necessary and as sensible as possible under the circumstances .   ( that is , as sensible as a nuclear " incident " can probably be . )  it does accomplish what it must : it avoids an all-out war , something that simply isn't possible because of its all-too-real consequences .  dramatically , the ending is quite powerful , and the use of o'herlihy's character as the symbolic " matador " ( providing a bookend to the film by ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the film's opening ) , is particularly appropriate .   " fail-safe " is a production of a major hollywood studio ( released by columbia pictures ) , and it has the structure of a high-tension suspense thriller that one might expect from a hollywood film .  nevertheless , under lumet's direction and walter bernstein's intelligent adaptation of burdick's and wheeler's novel , the film continues to have a lasting effect even after the events on screen have unfolded .  the film often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming .  but it was the conscious , human choice to * initialize * this automatic arming that " fail-safe " also finds dangerous .  in retrospect , the arms race seems to be one of the most puzzling exercises in futility of the century .  it's just fortunate that both sides were finally able to come to their senses and slow down , rather than continuing groeteschele's dangerous approach of speeding up and causing a possible meltdown .

pos	weir is well-respected in hollywood for turning scripts with difficult subject-matter into deceptively simple , powerful films , the mosquito coast ( utopia ) and fearless ( post-traumatic stress disorder ) among them .  in the truman show , weir essentially breathes life into the now-tired concept of media-manipulation by tackling the material from the inside-out .  it certainly helps that he has an underrated performer in top-form playing the title character , truman burbank .  by now you must be aware of the premise : unbeknownst to him , truman ( carrey ) is the star of his own tv series , a 24-7 peep-show in which he is surrounded by actors and placed in loosely scripted situations ; people around the world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill of his genuine reactions to fictitious stimulants .  `seahaven' , his hometown , and the show itself , are the brainchild of christof ( harris ) , who presides over his creation in the base of a fake moon , directing over 500 cameras and hundreds of actors and extras .  for 30 years , truman suspects nothing-`we accept the reality we're given , ' poses christof-but a desire to break free of the sunny town and visit a long lost love in `fiji' ( mcelhone , who was actually an actress fired by christof for trying to break the confidentiality agreement ) overwhelms him .  thus , christof and his team suddenly find themselves working twice as hard to keep the veneer of seahaven intact , lest truman discover the world outside and put an end to the highly-rated program .  in a few broad strokes , weir creates a convincing second-reality , and he has the good sense not to bring christof into the picture until almost three-quarters through .  this allows us to comprehend and accept truman's world before we contextualize it .  for all his madness , christof has shown the world a place without violence and hardship , and demonstrated that a human being can function well within it .  truman is an inspiration to his audience because he grew up to be , well , so darn nice ; like a sibling ( or , perhaps more appropriately , a caged animal in an interactive zoo ) , they want to see him succeed .  the surrealistic soap opera is completely plausible thanks to a tight screenplay and a sympathetic carrey-he really is an everyman here , abandoning his facial contortions in favour of a credible , wide-eyed bewilderment .  cinematically , the truman show is impeccable , stylishly photographed by peter biziou and littered with symbolic images .  as well , it employs wojciech kilar's piece " zycie za zycie' masterfully and beautifully .  if the film has any flaws , one may find them in laura linney's characterization as meryl , truman's " wife " ( i doubt that betty crocker impersonation would fool anyone ) , and in a subplot involving truman's `father' , which feels curiously incomplete .  there are a few stupendous sequences , and the film pulls off a wonderful trick : we become truman's audience as much as the loyal viewers in the film .  they wear buttons asking `how will it end ? '  i couldn't wait to know myself , though i didn't exactly want it to end , for this inspired movie is possibly the best-and most complex-summer picture in years .

"  despite violating nearly every rule of " legitimate " documentary film making , however , unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment .  while it sheds only a little light on the behind-the-scenes world of the fashion industry , it presents a fascinating , if incomplete , picture of designer mizrahi .  this man is the perfect subject for this kind of study -- he's funny , energetic , and eminently quotable .  he has unusual views on just about everything , from fashion ( " it's about women not wanting to look like cows " ) to mary tyler moore ( " between her and jackie kennedy , they shaped this country " ) to style ( " it's almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs " ) .  unzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress .  it's almost certainly different that anyone would imagine .  the designer draws on a variety of sources for his look , including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies , then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection .  in particular , unzipped traces mizrahi's development of his fall 1994 line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show , which highlights a number of prominent models , including cindy crawford , naomi campbell , kate bush , and linda evangelista .  on the technical side , a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped .  a variety of film stocks were used : super 8 , 16 mm black-and-white , and 35 mm color .  there is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness -- the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie , and , during the climactic fashion show , color is used to show the audience's perspective , while black-and-white is for the behind-the- scenes sequences .  nevertheless , some viewers will be put off by this treatment .  while unzipped isn't an expose on the fashion industry per se , keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear .  overall , however , this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else , and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed .  when the designer declares that " everything is frustrating except designing clothes -- that's beautiful and liberating , " it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed .

neg	steve martin is one of the funniest men alive .  if you can take that as a true statement , then your disappointment at this film will equal mine .  martin can be hilarious , creating some of the best laugh-out-loud experiences that have ever taken place in movie theaters .  you won't find any of them here .  the old television series that this is based on has its moments of humor and wit .  bilko ( and the name isn't an accident ) is the head of an army motor pool group , but his passion is his schemes .  every episode involves the sergeant and his men in one or another hair-brained plan to get rich quick while outwitting the officers of the base .   " mchale's navy " 's granddaddy .  that's the idea behind this movie too , but the difference is that , as far-fetched and usually goofy as the television series was , it was funny .  there is not one laugh in the film .  the re-make retains the goofiness , but not the entertainment .  everything is just too clean .  it was obviously made on a hollywood back lot and looks every bit like it .  it all looks brand new , even the old beat-up stuff .  martin is remarkably small in what should have been a bigger than life role .  in the original , phil silvers played the huckster with a heart of gold and more than a touch of sleaziness .  martin's bilko is a pale imitation .  the only semi-bright spot is phil hartman as bilko's arch-enemy .  it's not saying much , considering martin's lackluster character , but hartman leaves him in the dust .

neg	they should have stuck to the promise emblazoned on the original movie's poster : " no sequel . "  scary movie 2 is nowhere near as funny as its predecessor , and it is not because the wayans brothers , shawn and marlon doing the writing and keenen ivory behind the camera , don't try .  what defeats them is the genre they have chosen to spoof .  the first movie - an outrageous , low-brow , savage satire of teen slasher flicks such as scream and i know what you did last summer - succeeded because of its take-no-prisoners attitude toward a type of film that was in vogue , familiar and popular .  in scary movie 2 , the filmmakers take on the haunted house-ghost story format which , if you look at the grosses for such recent lame offerings as the respective remakes of the haunting and house on haunted hill , did not draw audiences nor enter the cultural psyche as did the various teen slasher series .  scary movie 2 does start off promising with a wonderful spoof of the exorcist , featuring james wood in the max von sydow role and veronica cartwright lampooning ellen burstyn .  of course split pea soup is the punch line - an overabundant amount , which offers the hope that the rest of the movie will be just as tasteless and excessive .  but this pre-credit sequence has nothing at all to do with the main action , which features the cast members from the original signing up to spend a weekend at a creepy haunted mansion as part of a university class project .  some of the jokes are as scatological and offensive as in the original , but they lack that take-no-prisoners bite that raised scary movie to the heights of burlesque .  scary movie 2 merely lurches from one lame sendup to another , offering weak spoofs of that nike shoe ad in which everyone does acrobatics with a basketball , and the films what lies beneath and hannibal ( features that only faired adequately at the box office ) , john woo's mission : impossible 2 and charlie's angels .  it is as if the wayans and their team of writers - at least seven are credited - just threw ideas in a blender and hoped they'd coalesce .  they don't .  while the pace of the original left you breathless , the sequel moves with the speed of an 18-wheeler carrying two tons of concrete up a steep mountain road .  you can almost hear the reels panting .  scary movie 2 tries very hard to live up to its original , but it falls very short .  it's a dissatisfying spectacle , a very weak sister of a very good movie .  the really scary aspect of this sequel is how disappointing it really is .

pos	after indecent proposal and up close and personal , redford was wise to direct himself in a picture at last .  redford may look great on-screen , but over the past few years , he's proven himself a bigger talent behind the camera .  ordinary people is one of the best films of the nineteen-eighties , and it was the first picture he helmed .  while the milagro beanfield war was only occasionally successful at combining magic-realism with . . . um ,  realism , and i've never been much of a fan of a river runs through it ( to the chagrin of many ) , quiz show was dazzling , energetic and convincing .  the horse whisperer represents both his directorial return to nature films and the first time in that sub-genre redford seems equally concerned with humans and scenery .  scott-thomas plays annie maclean , an uptight but respected new york magazine editor whose daughter grace ( johanssen ) loses a leg and a good friend when an early morning ride climaxes with their horses colliding with a semi .  grace's horse survived , but barely , and has gone mad .  annie refuses to put the animal out of his misery , believing that if the horse heals it will mend grace's newly-broken spirit .  eventually , mother and daughter travel alone to montana to be with tom booker ( redford ) , a famed " horse whisperer " who has a gift of calming horses with simple looks and touches , leaving busy husband neill behind .  eventually , they move onto the booker ranch with the rest of tom's family , and annie finds herself falling in love with all things montana , including , naturally , tom , the wise and lonely trainer .  the horse whisperer is delicately made .  i dare say lyrical , since to many people's ear , that word is synonymous with boring .  hardly .  the horse whisperer has little to offer in the way of surprise , but it does have an honesty that is refreshing and consistently enjoyable to watch , especially in the final third of the story .  scott-thomas and johanssen seem like mother and daughter , and you have no doubt believing that the mountain vistas would put these new yorkers under a spell , especially since d . p .  robert richardson's photography casts montana as heaven on earth .   ( a gimmicky but effective technique the filmmakers employ is a switch in aspect ratio from squarish to widescreen when the central location shifts from new york to montana . )  the underrated sam neill turns in perhaps his most heartfelt , emotive performance as the nice-guy husband , who is as authoritive and likeable as tom .  he is indeed a refreshing change from the sexist , lout of a husband so many writers resort to as a short-cut for explaining away the cheating spouse's motivation .  unfortunately , one of the horse whisperer's only flaws is the chemistry between would-be lovers scott-thomas and redford .  i liked both of them , but i didn't necessarily believe that redford would fall for such a cold fish , even if the countryside air thawed her slightly .  luckily ( and curiously ) , this is such a rich and textured movie that it doesn't quite matter-their adultery seems like an afterthought , the obligatory sub-plot that ties many of the characters' complex relationships together .

pos	the often misunderstood zabriskie point is antonioni 's political film , antonioni 's american film . stylistically , it follows suit after " blow - up " , meaning that the pace is faster than the previous epics , though certainly no less idiosyncratic . basically the common mistake is that the film glorifies the hippie generation . not so . the two protagonists come from vastly different environments . mark from the " rebel " youths , daria from an estate agency corporation . but in true antonioni fashion , they are both alienated , both trying to escape their surroundings . mark leaves a meeting of rebel students and black panthers disappointed with the verbose empty rhetoric , while daria keeps uneasily being on the move with her car . antionioni , the master director , after portraying the rebelling youth as confused and shallow , then moves to the city . an environment saturated by corporatism , billboard advertisements , meaninglessness , that has to keep expanding to accommodate the similar expansion of the population , generating a profit at the same time . it is this environment that the two protagonists escape from , though it seems mostly out of coincidence . indeed , when daria stops by a small village in the outskirts of the desert , the environment is just as suffocating , and the people just as lost cases , best exemplified by an old boxing champion , now reduced to a shadow of himself , sitting around drinking and smoking and talking nonsense . a stunning melancholy sequence , made even more powerful with the inclusion of some half wild children living around , brought in by some " benefactor " but " destroying a genuine piece of american history " . in a not - so - obscure symbolism , there is antonioni 's opinion on the hippies . just a half - positive glimpse in the canvas of human alienation . and then there is the desert , the landscape used to devastating effect , by turns pure and terrifying , primeval , wild and dead . the sequence where the two protagonists make love , " joined " in fantasy by the " flower " generation reflects the similar sequence in " red desert " , where giuliana tells her son a story . it is a colourful intermission in a colourless landscape . a vivid half - fantasy in a suffocating reality . the ending probably belongs to the pantheon of great endings in cinema , the western civilization blown to pieces . a catharsis , an exorcism . antionioni 's two " international " films ( the british " blow - up " and the american " zabriskie point " ) are lesser efforts than the previous masterpieces , but that is largely because of the faster pace and the inevitably contrived settings ( swinging london , flower - power america ) . but when it comes down to it , it 's clear he has n't lost the edge .
pos	let's face it : the $100 million-plus smash that was " goldeneye " was not a good film by any means , and as a bond movie was only marginally better than , say , " a view to a kill " or either of the timothy dalton pictures , by virtue of nice pacing .  but it did revive the series , and granted the producers some new directions in which to take the it ( ie .  the new " m " is a woman ) .   " tomorrow never dies " is the picture " goldeneye " should have been ; it's also the most entertaining bond outing since " the spy who loved me " .  the new picture opens with china considering war with britain after a standard military operation is misconstrued as a hostile threat from an english submarine .  as an attack occurs , the front-page headline is already being prepared , courtesy of carver media .  carver ( pryce ) the man is a deluded magnate , a sort of hybrid of ted turner , bill gates , and peter sellars' german scientist from " dr .  strangelove " ( physically , pryce even recalls sellars in his kubrick days ) .  it's up to james bond to take him down , with assistance , of course , from a wealth of gadgets ( including a multi-purpose cell phone ) , and beautiful women .  enter michelle yeoh , fresh from " supercop " , as a chinese secret agent with her own agenda ; with effortless grace , she cat burgles , dispatches baddies seemingly with the ease of preparing pasta , and refuses the advances of our philandering hero .  they make a great team .   " tomorrow never dies " is a surprisingly entertaining and efficient film , given that at the helm is none other than the director of " turner & hooch " .  spottiswoode has crafted some breathtaking set pieces , each much more intricate and impressive than , for instance , the tank scene in " goldeneye " .  moreover , brosnan has at last settled into the role some feel he was born to play ; last time out , the fate of the franchise rested on his shoulders , and there was noticeable discomfort in his body language .  returned in brosnan's eyes has some of the playfulness he demonstrated for so many years on tv's " remington steele " , as has his deadpan wit .  and though carver's motives are muddy ( when carver explains that " genius is insanity with some success " , screenwriter fierstein is taking a lazy shortcut ) , pryce makes an agreeable , memorable villain .  in the future , they should pursue actors as talented and experienced as pryce to breathe life into these cardboard figures .  there a few too many explosions in " tomorrow never dies " , perhaps so many they qualify as dialogue .  and it could have used a sharper script , though i was amused by the double entendres , none of which i will reveal here .  as it stands , the plot suffers many holes ( i'm not taking about implausibilities ) , and the dialogue tends towards the hackneyed .  now that the elements are in place : modern special effects and stunt work , cool pierce brosnan , kickass female allies . . .  it's time to put them to use in something truly special .  there's no mistaking , however , that " tomorrow never dies " is ideal holiday escapism , and for the first time in perhaps years , you'll walk out wanting more bond movies .  -reviewed december 17 , 1997  
neg	the first in a very long list of things wrong with " i still know what you did last summer " is the title .  think about it for a second .  if the last movie was called " i know what you did last summer " , wouldn't the next movie have to be " i still know what you did two summers ago " ?  if anyone working on this movie had an i . q .  greater than five would have thought about it logically and said , " hey . . .  wait a minute " .  but alas , the people behind this film are obviously idiots , so i won't hold them to that .  what i will hold them to is the fact that they have a pretty bad movie on their hands , even for a teenage slasher flick .  i guess i'm one of the few critics who actually kind of liked the original film ( emphasis on the " kind of " ) .  it wasn't great or anything and maybe not even necessarily good , but at least it didn't have me glancing at my watch every minute or so like it's sequel did .  there are just so many problems with this movie that it's hard trying to figure out where to start .  first of all , i guess , is the setting .  the movie offers no rational reason why the film had to take place in the bahamas , other than the fact that the producers wanted a seaside setting .  exactly why does the fisherman want to go through all the trouble of faking a radio contest to get julie james ( jennifer love hewitt , one of the only survivors of the first film ) and her new college buddies out to the islands before he hacks them up ?  the movie suffers from this kind of logic all the way through .  in one scene , julie is in a tanning booth at a deserted gym when the hooked fisherman with the slicker comes in and seals up the booth so the damsel in distress can't get out , no matter how hard she tries .  when julie discovers she's going to slowly fry to death , she screams for help and her friends come to her rescue .  now , this is all fine and dandy except for one thing ; instead of spending five minutes trying to bust open the booth , why not just turn the freakin' thing off ?  in another scene , one of the characters , after having their significant other all but decapitated by the man in the slicker , says to julie , " just don't tell anybody it rained the whole time . "  oh yeah , i've just been terrorized by a hook wielding sociopath and had some of my best friends gruesomely slaughtered , but hey , i'll crack jokes anyway .  after all , it is in the script .  the film's only saving graces are a few well-executed suspense sequences and a really cool cameo by the " re-animator himself , jeffrey combs .  he brings some good comic relief and life to an otherwise limp movie .  way to go , jeffrey .  i have a hunch that the reason this film fizzles while the first one at least kept it's head above water is the recent absence of writer kevin williamson .  with " scream " and even it's sequel , he displayed a real talent as a screenwriter .  his ear for dialogue and the terrific endings he puts on all his films make him a standout from all the rest of the horror writers , and i think " i still know " has really suffered by not having him on board .  the cool atmosphere is still there this time around , but i just didn't like the characters or the writing as much as i did in the first one .  even though the movie doesn't have williamson , it still has a hacky ending , trying to do what kevin did with the first two " scream " s by ( some may consider this a spoiler , but if you have seen any horror movies whatsoever , then you should be able to guess the identity of the madman within twenty minutes ) having two killers and , this time , having one of them being a family member to the other .  i think someone in the audience put it best when , after the movie had ended with another " the killer is back ! "  cliffhanger , he said " who is this time , the grandma ? "  all in all , " i still know " tries to be as successful as the first the film was , but really fails in the attempt .  i mean , it's okay when slasher movies rip-off each other , but when they start copying themselves . . .

' "  - that the actors are content to read the screenplay rather than invest much energy in trying to act it .  in the story , lee plenty ( cherot ) is a 28-year-old author and teaching assistant .  the movie , which happens mainly over the new year's holiday , consists of a series of incidents in which various single and married women try to kiss lee or take him to bed .  since he consistently refuses , caroline gooden ( tammi katherine jones ) figures that he must be gay .  eventually he and havilland " hav " savage ( chenoa maxwell ) get together , proving that he wasn't gay after all , just picky .  sexy women can sit on his lap and ask him to go to bed with them , but he will not even kiss them .  he's a man who knows his mind , which he frequently shares directly with the audience in a series of trite and overly cute monologues .  filled with wealthy african-americans , the story is closest in tone to love jones , which was better .  hav plenty's story doesn't go anywhere .  at the end it subjects us to lee plenty's new film , which is a movie of the movie we've just seen , but with even worse acting .   " remember folks that , as outrageous as this all seems , this is a true story .

"  a better title for this nostalgic mess would be " 50 missed opportunities . "  what is it that makes this retro-comedy such a downer ?  it's certainly not the cast , which includes enough hot , young talent for several movies .  there's courtney love , cementing her reputation as a serious actress ; christina ricci , hot off her shoulda-been-nominated turn in " the opposite of sex " ; paul rudd , who gets even more appealing with every role ; kate hudson , inheriting some fine acting genes from mom goldie hawn ; and affleck brothers ben and casey , two of the best things about " good will hunting . "  perhaps the question is this : what drew these and other immensely talented actors to such a dreary project ?  maybe it looked good on paper .   " 200 cigarettes " is composed of a series of vignettes , as various characters make their way through new york's festively decorated east village to a holiday bash thrown by a jittery bundle of nerves named monica ( martha plimpton , all dressed up in her best cyndi lauper ) .  among the potential guests are likeable cad kevin ( rudd ) and his best friend lucy ( love ) , busy bickering over his recent break-up , and a clumsy but seemingly charming bartender ( ben affleck ) who opens his mouth only to spew forth bad pick-up lines .  more subplots - _many_ more - dot the big picture , but those listed above are the only ones worth noting in a positive light .  all the other story tangents are as frazzled as a cokehead trying to solve a rubick's cube .  ricci and gaby hoffman grate as two ronkonkoma gals ( the kind that have trouble pronouncing hard consonants ) out to have a high time in the big city .  infamously acerbic comedienne janeane garofalo is wasted in what amounts to a several-scene cameo .  hudson , as a pretty-in-pink klutz recently devirginized by a reprehensible ladies' man ( jay mohr ) , trips , pukes and gets smeared with dog poop .  are we laughing yet ?  the film boils down to a mixture of the good , the bad and the gaudy , with the latter two overtaking the former .  game performances - especially by love , rudd and plimpton - are almost shot down by the bizarrely colorful parts and a constantly roving focus , here a combination that mostly sputters when it should crackle .  too many sidetracks rate as uninteresting and have little payoff until a lengthy final montage where we find out many of the performers served as one night stands for each other .  if this is " 200 cigarettes , " then get me 200 nicotine patches .

pos	bruce willis and sixth sense director m . night shyamalan re-team to tell the story of david dunne ( willis ) , a stadium security guard who has been having some problems at home that are affecting his relationship with his wife and child .  on a return trip from new york where he was trying to get a job , dunne is in a horrible train accident that he is the only survivor of .  to make things even stranger , dunne has also escaped the accident completely unscathed .  a comic book art dealer named elijah price ( samuel l . jackson ) , who was born with a degenerative bone disease that causes his bones to be so brittle that they break constantly , has been seeking out someone like dunne his entire life .  price felt that there had to be someone exactly the opposite of him . . .  someone whose bones would be so strong that they would never break .  price contacts dunne and convinces him to come down to his gallery for a talk where he suggests that dunne could quite possibly be something akin to a superhero from the comic books price used to read when he was a child .  dunne doesn't believe him at first , but price assists him in discovering his " powers " and helps him hone his craft until he discovers what his true calling really is .  writer/director m . night shyamalan had a tough act to follow with his sleeper hit the sixth sense .  how exactly does one follow up on one of the biggest and most popular thrillers in recent years ?  for shyamalan , the answer must have come as easy to him as nuclear physics does to kindergartners .  does this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash , though ?  the answer to that question is not a very easy one , either .  as far as pacing goes , the sixth sense seemed almost interminable .  it wasn't until the surprise ending was revealed that i realized the film was actually intentionally ( and perfectly ) paced in order to give the audience ample time to re-connect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached .  for unbreakable , shyamalan gave the film a much more satisfying pace which , in many ways , blows away the film that had come before .  the story moves along at a steady pace and shyamalan's direction is excellent , with the camera almost constantly moving .  there are tons of great shots in the film , not least of which is a conversation that opens the film between willis' character and another train passenger .  the shot seems as though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats and the camera steadily glides back and forth between the two actors as they speak .  also very impressive is the film's score by james newton howard ( who also scored shyamalan's sixth sense and the similar film stir of echoes , as well as this year's dinosaur ) .  several of the scenes are driven by a very catchy beat and help to increase the tempo of the film .  one of the best examples of this is a scene in which dunne goes into a train station to " exercise " his powers .  the music , in combination with the stellar visuals , really go a long way towards making this an incredible movie .  if there was any one soundtrack i would make a must purchase this year , this one would be it .  the film also boasts some great performances , including a precocious child actor trying to vie for the oscar throne left vacant by haley joel osment .  willis turns in a great performance as the sad sack dunne , who just can't seem to figure out why he's been depressed for the last few years .  his character almost seems pathetic when we first meet him , but he eventually grows into his own under elijah's tutelage .  jackson is one of the better actors of our time , and here he turns in yet another great performance as the ever injured elijah .  though his hairstyle is absurd , jackson seems to infuse such a great deal of pain into his role that the mortar board hairdo can easily be overlooked .  robin wright penn's role seems slightly underwritten , but she still manages to get across the intense hurt of her character's need for love from her husband and her desire to make things work again .  spencer treat clark , as the dunne's young son jeremy , shows that shyamalan still has a knack for picking young actors , and he turns in one of the most competent performances in the film .  out of all the characters , jeremy's is perhaps the most emotional , and clark does a great job with the role .  where the film does lose points though , is during its " surprise " ending .  shyamalan has said in interviews that he was going to do an ending that blew away the one presented by the sixth sense , but i found myself saying " that was it ? ! "  when unbreakable revealed its own ending .  it's not that the ending is bad , it's just that the ending doesn't quite have the emotional punch that the other film's did .  plus , it almost seems like it sets itself up for sequels ( and i won't reveal the ending here , but you'll understand what i mean when you see it ) .  essentially , what all of this means is that shyamalan has made another good film with unbreakable .  the only real problem is that the ending doesn't quite fill the shadow left by its predecessor .  as long as it isn't held to the standard that sixth sense set ( which it ultimately will be ) , it should be a remarkably well liked film .  one thing seems clear , though .  shyamalan definitely has an affinity for comic books that he would like to share with the world and many comic book fans will also delight the vision he presents in this film .

pos	it's rather strange too have two computer animated talking ant movies come out in a single year , but that is what disney and pixar animation ; s latest film represents .  while a bugs life isn't nearly as deep as it's predecessor , dreamwork's antz , it is just as funny .  a bug's life centers , appropriately , around the life of an ant , named flik .  flik , cutely voiced by newsradio's david foley , hates sticking too tradition and attempts too find new ways of harvesting food and other task .  when one of his inventions causes the offering too be completely lost , the leaders of the colony send him out on a mission too get him out of the way .  the offering is food that a vile group of grasshoppers force the ants too harvest for them .  the leader of the grasshoppers is hopper , who is fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey .  when the offering is lost hopper is very upset and he vows to return shortly too retrieve double the amount of food .  when the leaders of the ant colony send flik out on his mission , they never dream he will be successful , they just hope they can get him out of the way so they can harvest the extra food .  flik's mission is too hire some warrior bugs too fight off the grasshoppers when they return .  instead flik accidentally hires circus performing bugs , who he mistakenly assumes are warriors .  when he returns with the `warriors' , the town is ecstatic until they find out the truth about their heroes .  a bug's life has animation that is simply stunning .  the sheer uniqueness of the day to day bug life is very imaginative .  together with the great voice acting , this film is the perfect holiday family film .  its main weakness is that it couldn't beat antz to the theaters , making it seem like stale material .

neg	it's a rare treat when a quality horror film is released in the theater .  and unfortunately with man's best friend , we'll be waiting a while longer .  the film stars ally sheedy and lance henrikson in a tale of bio-genetics gone wrong .  sheedy plays a nosy reporter whose need for a " good " story provokes her to snoop inside of emax , a poorly guarded million dollar bio-lab that she finds herself effortlessly intruding .  the result : she unleashes the experimental wonder dog named max , a german shepherd with genetic recombination allowing it to swallow like a snake , camouflage like a chameleon , climb trees like a leopard , and attack with the strength of tiger .  max takes a liking to sheedy , and she finds herself protecting the animal from the cruel technological realm of emax , owned by henrikson .  well , it doesn't take long before the hormonally unstable biohazard unleashes his jowls upon the unsuspecting suburban landscape which offers max juicy leg of mailman , etc . . .  sheedy is a boring non-presence on the screen , tripping through the enormous plot chasms neglected by the writer/director ( i apologize for a lack of credits .  i suppose i was eager to leave the theater , and in my rush , forgot to take note of the director , writer , producer , etc . . . ) .  henrikson offered the only relief from the contrived narration of the script , giving his character as much development as he could considering the flat dialogue plaguing the film .  the movie depends upon it's ability to impress the audience with animal special effects , but all it presents is a dog that can growl , open door handles with his paw , sit , roll over , play dead , and sick .  the rest of the special effects were so poor , i found them offensive .  the film attains sub-mediocrity , an unambitious film at best .  horror fans might find that cujo offers a better bite .

neg	for those interested in the true spirit of moviemaking - or what's left of it in mainstream hollywood - movie which are star vehicles are terrible things .  as a rule , the ignore general principles of cinema because they are not made to advance the media but rather to advance the career of a particular actor .  an actor might be chosen on the up-and-up , to give him exposure ; or he might be chosen on the way down to hand him a paycheck .  generally , though , the actor doesn't matter , and soldier , the latest from the beleaguered warner brothers , exemplifies this : the picture lacks pizazz .  the star for the vehicle in this case is kurt russell , otherwise known as the man of thirty words or less .  russell plays todd , a human trained from birth in the ways of waging war and becoming emotionally distanced from the carnage he has wrought .  the movie lets us see this degenerate process , but by the time the real plot starts , we're into todd's later years .  he's about to be replaced by a new breed of soldiers , ones who , instead of being trained * from * birth , are genetically selected * before * birth .  the pride of this class - caine 607 ( jason scott lee ) - will be our villain , and you know he's the villain because he has a staring contest with our hero near the movie's start .  between the two leads , less than a full typed page of dialogue is spoken , and it's possible to imagine a script which is ninety percent stage direction .  director paul anderson , who helmed last year's icy thriller , event horizon , doesn't show any inventiveness here and instead is content to let the actions play out on screen ad nauseam .  todd , upon being replaced , is left to die on a garbage planet ; but in order to stretch the running time out , the villains return to the garbage planet on a " routine patrol " and set the stage for the final firefight .  events are predictable from the time that the setups are made , and neither anderson nor scriptwriter david peoples attempts to show any creativeness here .  the most annoying plot facet is the reason that the whole of the movie comes to be : todd fails to show physical superiority against caine - in fact , not even todd and two of his companions can best the baddie - but near the end of the movie he shows remarkable prowess with automatic weaponry .  it's not as though todd undergoes any significant character changes throughout the plot of the story , and so the plot has a very canned feeling about it .  the best route through this disaster is to take it lighthearted in spirit , and treat it as a parody of typical action fare , like universal soldier .  a strict interpretation , however , reveals an unmistakeable and unforgiveable lack of style , class , or substance ; and by next year , a large percentage of the people who have seen this will have taped it off of network television .

" why did n't you switch the channel if you did n't like it ? " , you might ask angrily . fair point , fair point ... the answer is that i wanted to , but the pain was so sudden and excruciating that i fell to the floor , writhing in agony . with my last ounces of energy , i tried to reach the remote but could n't . a silly little fisherman with the questionable talent of singing with an annoying opera voice is discovered by niven , who then proceeds to " pigmalionize " him . lanza is in love with asymmetrical grayson , but she predictably treats him with contempt until they finally hook up . this may seem like a rather thin plot , but this noisy movie is so chock - full of singing and music that there is barely any dialogue at all . this movie is relentless . forget about torturing hippies and war prisoners with slayer 's " reign in blood " ( as in a south park episode ) . whatever little conversation there is amongst the silly adults that infest this strange 50s musical world , it 's all infantile - as if they were all 6 year - olds impersonating grown - ups . i can only envy people who find movies like this funny . it must be great being easy - to - please : what a world of wonder would open up to me if only i could enjoy any silly old gag as hilarious , gut - busting comedy .   but let 's examine this phenomenon , the 50s musical . my best guess is that 50s musicals offered the more day - dreaming idealists among us a glimpse into utopia or heaven ( depending on whether you 're church - going or lenin's - tomb - going ) , or at least very cheesy version of these fantasy - inspired places . ttono is more akin to a representation of hell , but that 's just me . i do n't seem to " get " musicals . people talk , there is a story - but then all - of - a - sudden everyone starts singing for about 4 minutes after which they abruptly calm down and then pretend as if nothing unusual happened ! when you think about it , musicals are stranger than any science - fiction film . worse yet , ttono ( my favourite type of pizza , btw ) is not just a 50s musical , but one with opera squealing . opera is proof that there is such a thing as over - training a voice - to the point where it becomes an ear - piercing weapon rather than a means of bringing the listener pleasure . the clearest example of this travesty is when lanza and grayson unite their dark side vocal powers for a truly unbearable duet . i tried lowering the volume . i lowered it from 18 to 14 . then from 14 to 10 . then 8 . i ended up lowering it to a 1 , which is usually so low that it 's only heard by specially - trained dogs and certain types of marsupials , and yet i still could hear those two braying like donkeys ! take the scene in the small boat in the river . danza starts off with one of his deafening , brain - killing tunes , and then ... nothing . no animals anywhere to be seen . even the crocodiles , who are mostly deaf , have all but left . if you look carefully , you might even see the trees change colour , from green to yellow , in a matter of minutes . no , this was not a continuity error , it was plain old torture of the flora . and those trees were just matte paintings ! imagine how real trees would have reacted . the reason glass breaks when a high c is belched out of the overweight belly of an operatic screamer is not due to any laws of physics relating to waves and frequency , but because glass is only human - hence can take only so much pain before committing suicide through spontaneous self - explosion . i can listen to the loudest , least friendly death metal band for hours , but give me just a minute of a soprano and i get a splitting headache .

pos	i want to correct what i wrote in a former retrospective of david lean's war picture .  i still think that it doesn't deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute's list of the 100 greatest american movies .  and i think that lumet's " 12 angry men " , wilder's " witness for the prosecution " and kubrick's " paths of glory " would have been better choices for the best picture oscar in 1958 .  but i can't deny the importance of " the bridge on the river kwai " - cinematically and in its contents .  the film is set in burma in 1943 .  a bataillon of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai .  but the british commanding officer , colonel nicholson ( alec guinness ) , insists - corresponding to the geneva conventions - that his officers needn't work as simple workmen .  struggling toughly , col . nicholson forces the japanese commandant , col . saito ( sessue hayakawa ) , to give way in this respect .  afterwards col . nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge .  he considers it an opportunity to raise his men's morale , and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese .  but the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge , among them the american shears ( william holden ) - an escapee from the japanese prison camp - and the british major warden ( jack hawkins ) . . .  a flaw of the picture is the clich ? d characterization of the japanese people .  they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british - as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge .  and the film doesn't consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in " paths of glory " .  lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies .  this is also perceptible in the conversations between col . nicholson and col . saito .  in this regard it is symptomatic that shears , who doubts the military logic , is a somehow unpleasant person in the film .  the audience is supposed to applaud col . nicholson's perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not .  the spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col . nicholson takes for his men .   ( the plot by-passes these risks . )  that means , the picture isn't perfect .  but it has a lot of virtues as well .  it shows the " madness " of war and what war can produce in people's minds .  it shows how col . nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others ( like shears ) get cynics .  and " the bridge on the river kwai " is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests .  these points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti-war film ( despite the inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme ) .  david lean's effective and atmospherically perfect direction creates a high suspense , especially in the dramatic ( though not wholly plausible ) showdown .  alec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col . nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character .  the other actors deliver very good performances as well .  jack hildyard's fine color cinematography and the apt score are also helpful .  i like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses .

neg	when you get to the scenes that involve albert brooks without his shirt ... try not to gag on a fur ball . i like albert brooks . i 've seen most , if not all of his movies but it was the first time seeing this one . modern romance is an interesting take on the subject of love . there are few movies that handle the desperation of love as well or as overtly as modern romance , although 1979 's chilly scenes of winter comes very close . they both essentially deal with obsessed men that are too psychologically attracted / obsessed to their respective women . where - as chilly scenes of winter borders on the subject stalking , this movie has a more grounded foundation with the subject of love because both people are already in a relationship .. and out of the relationship .. and back in it again . and because it 's a movie that was released in 1981 , it is of its time in terms of styles and such . that 's the main reason i like this movie . my basic rule when it comes to movies is " if it sucks at least it may have some historic relevance " , you know time capsule stuff . which leads me to the horrific scenes of albert brooks sans shirt . the man is hair . very hair . like he 's wearing a black curly fur sweater - hairy . and what 's worse is he almost looks burn victim - hairy . it 's not a pleasant sight and the scenes with him without a shirt go on and on . back in the early 80 's hairy men were seen as normal and nothing shocking . but in 2009 the sight of something like this is just plain revolting . sorry , albert ! i wish at some point someone said " hey let 's try this scene but with you wearing a simple t - shirt , i mean you might scare people " . it 's just really bad and i feel sorry for the poor pretty actress that had to deal with albert brooks naked body on top of hers . she was probably pulling out his hairs from her teeth for days after that . anyway , it 's an ok movie . it could have been better if i had n't see albert brooks without his shirt for what seemed like 10 long continuous minutes because that will forever taint my viewing of this movie .

" the celebration " is great because it's chock full of those .  it creates a world so completely realistic that everything that occurs is as memorable as the little instances of life that catch your attention and stay with you for the rest of your life .  and then it makes things just a tad bit farscial , just to make sure you're paying attention , which you are because what transpires is just so goddam interesting that if you were to ever feel bored , then you're of your attention span needs a bit of a tuning-up .  the story takes place at the extravagant home of an aging patriarch ( henning mortizen ) , who has just turned 60 and is having a party thrown for him .  all his friends and family turn up , and for the first half hour , we get introduced to everyone , simplistically and realistically ( no aggravatingly condescending posing for the camera deals here ) .  the eldest son , christian ( ulrich thomsen , looking a bit like a young malcolm mcdowell ) , is the first to be seen in the film , walking to his father's home .  his brother , michael ( thomas bo larsen ) , drives by , pulls over , greets him , then kicks his family out of the car , forcing them to walk to the estate , just so christian can be comfortable .  we then meet helene ( paprika steen ) , their sister , a woman who always seems to be stressed-out , who invites the driver of her car ( gbatokai dakinah ) , an american , to to come join her at the party she's going to .  once they're all there and settled in , the party begins , and as custom , the eldest son has to make a speech to his dad , so christian stands up , at the head of the table , and reveals the film's punchline : his father raped all his children at a young age .  but since this is a family/friends affair , his confession becomes more detested than the supposed truth , and is simply brushed off despite his efforts , and what transpires is sorta like jerry springer crossed with jean renoir , and it's all terribly interesting to watch .  twists occur , and soon the film has taken on a nearly-farsical nature , but still seems realistic because the people involved really feel like they could reach such ends .  the most notorious thing about this film , which has been getting the most notice , though , is that the director , thomas vinterberg has shot it in a completely awkward fashion .  as a member of the danish filmmakers clan , dogme 95 , a group that has vowed to oppose " the auteur concept , make-up , illusions , and dramaturgical predictability " so that they may " purge film so that once again the inner lives of the characters justify the plot . "  i have not seen " breaking the waves , " the other notable film by a member of this group ( lars von trier , to be exact ) , but " the celebration " works exquisitely in this department .  it feels like reality , like you're actually watching real people and not actors , and as a major pointer , has been shot on video .  as a result , it looks more like the home movies you never dare shot of your family than an actual film , but always wanted to .  we see key moments in people's lives that they wouldn't dare show to the world , and it captures the farscial comedy of life so accurately and acutely that this style , as ironically-showmanship as it really is , works perfectly for the nature of the film .  the key , though , to this film , and the reason it's not just a cool danish import , is because this film is not about revealing the truth as much as it is about the way people react to such an explosive truth .  throughout the film , we see a completely realized debate over the truth and the effects it has on the lives of those who have learned to live with lies , a debate so three-dimensional that it could easily blow oliver stone and his the-truth-at-all-costs reasoning out of the water .  of course it was not right for the father to rape his children , and of course , they couldn't have fought back then , and of course this has created scarring suppression inside them .  and yes , it's thearapeutic for one to release the truth years later , when they know it could easily destroy the one who emotionally destroyed them earlier .  but then again , the father , after all , is not a totally bad guy , and we can see the emotional complications that arise thanks to a performance by mortizen which is just so great and touching that while we do believe that he could have raped his children years earlier , we also see a man who has also learned to live with what he's done , and deep down , feels true guilt that is only now beginning to surface .  the final scene , involving mortizen and everyone else , is utterly devastating , thanks to him and thomsen , whose performance is utterly flawless and equally emotionally complex .  everyone else is flawless as well - the actors never seem to be stepping into the shoes of their characters as much as they do walking comfortably in them .  the actors or writers have not made the mistake to judge these characters in the slightest : there are no whites or blacks but instead all grays , exactly like life .  as such , " the celebration " may be the one truly bizarro film of the year : a work of art so eerily close to reality that it's utterly disturbing and utterly fascinating .

pos	jacques tati's 1953 classic " les vacances de m . hulot " ( also known as " mr . hulot's vacation , " in english ) ought to be the textbook on how to do non ? dialogue comedy in film .  the characters hardly ever speak to each other directly , and the film operates on the paper ? thin premise that monsieur hulot , played by tati himself , is awkward and clumsy and generally manages to annoy the other guests at the beach resort hotel where he is taking a week's vacation .  yet the film had me beside myself laughing more consistently than any in recent memory .  part of the reason the film works so well is the clever setup for the various gags .  slapstick has often been regarded as an unsophisticated and even crude form of comedy , but i think part of the reason for this is that it often seems forced : you can only see movie characters start running after something and then crash face-first into a pole so many times before you start to wonder what all these poles are doing there in the first place or why these people don't watch where they're going .  in " les vacances de m . hulot , " the gags build upon each other and often start out relatively low-key .  in one sequence , for example , hulot is painting the side of his small row boat on the beach when , while his back is turned , the paint can gets caught up in the oncoming waves , washes away , then comes back up on the other side of the boat .  while crossing over to get the can , hulot steps in the boat and unknowingly cracks it .  when he actually takes the boat out into the water , it breaks in half , but the two halves flip up against each other , trapping him inside as the bystanders mistake it for a shark fin and panic on the beach ensues .  tati doesn't waste a single opportunity for humor ; scenes that might have yielded one joke in most comedies are good for at least four or five in this film .  it has been said that comedy relies on frustrating the audience's expectations , and " les vacances de m . hulot " succeeds brilliantly in that area as well .  tati accomplishes this largely through a sort of deadpan understatement .  when hulot goes into a separate room during dinner and starts playing a record at defeaningly loud volume , no fights or shouting matches ensue ; instead , the waiter calmly walks in and shuts off the power in the room , disconnecting the record player and leaving a puzzled hulot sitting in the dark .  tati also uses running gags to this effect , allowing them to keep running far longer than most comedy directors would ; more often than not , we can see them coming and think , " oh , he's not going to do that again , " but , lo and behold , he does .  for example , there is a recurring joke in which hulot's noisy , sputtering car engine wakes everyone in the middle of the night as an exterior shot reveals the hotel's lights coming on one by one .  then this image turns up again in the finale , which i will not give away other than to say that involves a lot more noise in the middle of the night than a car engine could ever produce .  the ending is one of two elements that really make this a four-star film as opposed to merely an above-average , clever comedy .  as much as i was laughing during this film , i was thinking to myself occasionally that tati had to top himself at the end to really make this work as a complete viewing experience ; suffice it to say that he did .  the other important aspect is that the film never seems disdainful of its characters .  it easily could have turned the tables on hulot and had the other guests exact some kind of revenge on him ; alternatively , it could have portrayed the others as humorless curmudgeons .  instead , tati seems to regard his characters with cheerful amusement more than anything else and invites the audience to like them , however strange or irritating they might seem .   " les vacances de m . hulot " is not subtitled , but the dialogue is sparse and for the most part not terribly essential to the flow of events .  anyone with a taste for this kind of absurd humor ought to make this film their next rental from the video store .  note : " les vacances de m . hulot " was not rated by the mpaa .  it would at most receive a pg rating .

neg	as you should know , this summer has been less than memorable .  with a total of 4 decent films , it's not a surprise that these big budget failures keep appearing .  with that said , you can pretty much predict what my opinion on " the 13th warrior " will be .  the film is based on the michael crichton " eaters of the dead " , in which ahmed ibn fahdlan is banished from his country for looking at a wife of a king .  after tarveling for many months , he comes across a gang of norsemen , who are forced to pick 13 men to protect a town from mythical monsters who travel in the fog .  so , they start picking men , and are left without 1 , thus ahmed is choosen .  so far it sounds interesting right ?  not when all of this takes place in 15 minutes .  after that , they basically run around killing .  that alone shows how much a script is needed for a film , because once your story is introduced , you have the rest of the film to start developing it .  obviously that's not the case here .  even if you are going into the film expecting an action packed adventure , you will be disappointed .  since all the action takes place in fog , it is constantly hard to see a scene clearly due to those circumstances , and to poor camera work .  can't the camera men sit still ?  i'd like to actually watch a film in focus , but again , they failed to deliver that as well .  the film moves on and on until the point , where you can care less about anything but the popcorn you're eating .  with corny dialogue , that the characters laugh at for some odd reason , a script that goes nowhere , dull action sequences , a predictable ending , and worst of all weak characters , there's basically nothing to like here , except for maybe the set designs .  that's the only thing that honestly caught my interest .  when i heard that john mctiernan , the director , wanted his name kept out of the project , that made me wonder why ?  well now i know .  crichton's greed forced mctiernan to edit his finished product , which led to a big arguement .  what's there to argue about anyway ?  the film couldn't be saved , no matter how much they spent or casted .  seeing films like the haunting and big daddy making money , i wouldn't be surprised to see " the 13th warrior " become a hit .  please do me a favor and save your money at all costs , or else you will be lost in the fog , like the film itself .

neg	 " mission to mars " is one of those annoying movies where , in the middle of the movie , you get the sneaking suspicion that the reason the trailer looks so good is because they showcased all the best parts of the movie : all five minutes of it .   " mission " * does * give you payoff ; but when it does come , it's too little , too late .   " mission " has some good ideas , but they get lost in the unbearably boring delivery , dime-a-dozen dialogue , and spate of good actors wasted in cardboard-cutout roles .  i'm sure the director and writers were very proud of each hallmark moment they came up with , so they stretch each dramatic moment out like silly putty until it loses all its charm .  glances don't communicate any deeper emotions just because you draw them out for five hours on end .  the film spends an hour on this kind of stuff , building to its climax .  a lot of it is a cliched glorification of family relationships , marriage , friendship , unite we stand divided we fall kind of crap .  there are some spectacular special effects sequences in this film , and i give it points for trying to stay true to the science i know ( trying is the key word here ) .  the sequence with the martian demonstrating their history is oddly beautiful and touching , but as mentioned by then we're so sick of the goddamn thing we want the movie to be over .  great design , good intentions , but no cigar .  if you're not a die hard sci-fi , fx or jerry o'connell fan ( his character is the only one who has some semblance of character ) , don't waste your eight bucks on this .  and what the hell , tim robbins died halfway through the movie , in a stupid way too .  that's just unforgiveable .

pos	no awards show can please all the people . clearly if your favorite movies did n't win , you will say the show was n't very good . that 's understandable . however , the 74th annual academy awards will be remembered for one magical moment of hollywood history : woody allen 's first appearance ever at the academy awards . allen has often shunned the awards as being self - aggrandizing and pointless , and has never attended -- even though he has won several of the coveted awards . when the 74th academy awards were held , the nation was still mourning the loss of life in the collapse of the world trade centers in new york . when it came time to pay tribute to the city of new york , they decided to show a video of the great movie moments form the city of cities . then the announcer simply said : " ladies and gentleman , oscar award winning director woody allen . " the place erupted in an extremely long standing ovation . the entertainment industry finally got to give their applause to the man from new york who usually avoids the hollywood scene . as the applause died down , woody applied some of his legendary wit to the situation . some highlights : " thank you very much - that makes up for the strip search . " " i thought they wanted their oscars back , " he joked . " i panicked because the pawn shop has been out of business for ages and i had no way of retrieving anything . " " but that was n't it . i could n't work it out because my movie was n't nominated for anything this year . then it hit me - maybe they were calling to apologise . " allen also disclosed why he had overlooked his lifelong oscar - aversion for this one special night . " for new york city , i 'd do anything . so i got my tux on and came down here , " said allen . " it 's a great , great movie town . it 's been a great , moving and exciting backdrop for movies and it remains a great , great city . "
pos	usually when a blockbuster comes out , it's loaded with effects , stars , bad scripts , and plenty of action .  mystery men may contain an all-star cast , and efects , but the clever script and characters are what really works , which is rare to see this year .  the film is based upon the comic book series " the flaming carrot " by bob burden , in which 3 wanna be super heroes try and fight crime , only to be out done by the real hero of champion city , captain amazing ( greg kinnear ) .  things go a little haywire , when the sinister casanova frankenstein ( geoffrey rush ) is released into the city , where he captures captain amazing , and plans to wreak havoc upon champion city .  well , the trio decide to take matters in their own hands , by saving the city , but first they need some assitance .  this is where the film takes a turn for the better .  in the beggining , there were only 3 wanna be heroes .   " blue raja ( hank azaria ) , " mr . furious ( ben stiller ) and " the shoveller ( william h . macy ) .  sure they were enterataining , but their acts grew old fast .  that is until they aquire " invisible boy " ( kel mitchell ) , and " the bowler " ( janeane garafalo ) and " mr . splein " ( paul reubens ) , 2 of which rescue the film from becoming a disastorous mess .  thankfully , the original 3 heroes become amusing , with some support of reuben and garfalo on screen .  the whole premise is rather ridiculous , but packs a few punches to keep interest .  for one , the film is considerably clever .  it literally pokes fun at super hero films , like batman and robin , superman etc . in fact , many scenes are similar to batman and robin , including the opening sequence , only altered in a humorous and superior way .  a part of the cleverness comes from the cast .  sometimes a film with such talent is overblown , but the acting is what keeps it alive here .  while azaria and macy were enteratining , 2 characters really stood out .  one was paul reuben .  no matter how disgusting or revolting " mr . splein " may be , you still can't help but laugh .  it' so incredibly moronic , it's just a riot watching reuben relieve himself of bodily functions .  janeane garafalo also was an interesting character .  she seemed to be the most outgoing and convincing character on screem , due to her enthusiasm , that kept the film flowing .  men is worth seeing alone , for those 2 troubled heroes .  on the downside , a few of the heroes and especially the villain never really lift off .  kel mitchell and geoffrey rush , were both utterly useless .  their parts were so limited , they'd be lucky at all to be on screen for more than 20 minutes .  ben stiller too was wasted , mostly because of his unlikeable power and dialogue .  none of these characters get a rise out of anybody , but happily they are lost in the charming flow of the film .  as far as the budget goes , it was wisely spent on the cast , not the effects .  while the set designs and action all look nice , i'm glad there was a seperate aspect , that the film focused on , and for that i applaud .  slow at times , and rather pointless , mystery men still delivers .  it forgets about money making , because it's not likely to make a bundle like it's proceeders , and that's what works .  stupid ?  maybe , but for once i'm not disappointed .  no one expected an intelligent film , but you get a film thats wit captures your attention and makes you forget this miserable year .

"  new line cinema spent millions of dollars creating the expressionistic film noir visuals and paying the actors , and doesn't have any way to get it back .  i paid $4 . 25 for a matinee screening and don't have any way to get my money back , either .  you'll hear a lot from other critics about the look and feel of this movie .  i will admit that the cinematographers and costume designers and set artists and cgi graphics geeks all worked hard to create a stunning , nightmarish future world where it's always a late night in 1948 , complete with rotary phones and automats and fedoras .  i've got news for you fellows -- i don't care how hard you worked , or how visually stunning this movie looks -- you wasted your time and mine , working on a movie without a plot , without a clear sense of direction of where it wanted to go , without a soul or a reason to care .  the movie starts out oh-so-promising .  john murdoch ( rufus sewell ) is lying in a bathtub in the sort of seedy hotel that in real life , would have been boarded up long ago .  there is a dead , mutilated prostitute in the other room -- a surprise , as he has lost his memory .  the phone rings : it's a sinister-sounding man , claiming to be his doctor , telling him to flee for his life .  all well and good , right ?  wrong .  apparently , someone decided that the audience was just a bit too dim to figure out the intricacies of the plot .   ( this is getting to be a popular assumption in hollywood . )  so , the actual beginning of the movie is not sewell running for his life , rather , it's a voice-over narration by the aforementioned doctor ( keifer sutherland ) explaining exactly what is going on and who is responsible .  it's as though sam the piano player had told us that rick and ilsa had been getting it on in paris in the first three minutes of casablanca .  no , wait , that's not fair to casablanca .  it's more like watching a new plotline at the first of the show -- or if you want to know how i really feel , having an off-screen narrator explain that gilligan won't be getting off the island in this episode .  >from here , the coherence of the plot goes down faster than ( insert monica lewinsky joke here ) .  the characters just wander around the city aimlessly and bump into each other for no apparent reason , and that's what moves the plot .  what we're left with is a string of unanswered questions that don't make any sense .  we're given aliens with unlimited omnipotent powers , yet they forget to use them at critical moments and get themselves killed .  we're given a hero who can " tune " into these same powers , yet he only uses them when it's convenient to the plot .  we're given a whole long list of loose ends that go nowhere  usually , critics will say that an actor playing an underwritten part " isn't given much to do . "  in this movie , no one is given anything to do .  sewell is given the impossible role of a man who doesn't remember anything , and plays it like . . .  um . . .  a man who doesn't remember anything .  the aliens are tall , pasty-faced , and bald , and wear long black cloaks and fedoras to remind us that they're evil -- and there's a child alien as well , straight out of an anne rice novel .  sutherland is saddled with a limp , a twitchy eye , and a breathy accent to remind us that he's in league with the aliens .  to its credit , dark city boasts two impressive bits of casting .  william hurt is perfectly cast as the world-weary inspector charged with catching the man who is murdering prostitutes all over the city .  jennifer connelly , playing sewell's love interest , is given two all-too-brief moments on screen as a lounge singer -- and turns in the sexiest performace this side of jessica rabbit .  but instead of the dogged policeman and the femme fatale given central treatment in the script ( the way they would be in any self-respecting noir movie ) they're almost tangiential to the plot , such as it is .  the problem with dark city is this : it's a bad science fiction movie pretending to be film noir .  the essence of film noir isn't , as proyas seems to beleive , breathy dialogue or snap-brim fedoras or tall , bald evil villains who would make peter lorre curl up in a corner .  dark city has not one bit of intrigue , moral ambiguity , suspense , or anything else that keeps us coming back to the noir classics .  dark city is like the intricately carved door that kate winslet floats on in titanic .  it's an exceptionlly well-made and intricately designed piece of flotsam , sailing around and around the middle of the ocean , going nowhere .  
neg	i wish more films would take on issues of faith and morality in the modern world .  and i wish that film-makers would use commandments as a blueprint on how _not_ to do it .  writer/director daniel taplitz has created a bizarre conglomeration of satire and soul-searching in this tale of seth warner ( aidan quinn ) , a man of faith who runs into a streak of bad luck which usually inspires country-western lyrics : his pregnant wife drowns , his home is destroyed by a tornado , he loses his job and his dog is crippled by a bolt of lightning .  convinced that god has broken his half of the covenant , seth decides to break his , and sets out to turn every " thou shalt not " of the ten commandments into a " thou shalt " ( and vice versa ) .  his wife's sister rachel ( " friends " ' courteney cox ) wants to help seth ; rachel's selfish husband harry ( anthony lapaglia ) , who tends to break a few commandments of his own , thinks seth is a lunatic .  thus begins a film which picks the wrong tone for every occasion .  taplitz isn't interested in treating seth's tragedies as genuinely tragic , making it impossible to sympathize with him .  composer joseph vitarelli provides a score full of whimsical woodwinds , turning seth's sacrilegious mission into an amusing lark ; quinn's performance as seth is all wild-eyed fervor without any genuine pain .  the actual breaking of the commandments is almost treated as an afterthought , with one through five dispatched in a five-minute montage .  the result is a character whose actions feel less like the authentic responses of an anguished man than the machinations of a high-concept movie plot .  it's not even entirely clear that commandments is about seth .  corporate attorney rachel is given a case which is supposed to soften a hard heart we see no indication she has , while harry gets his comeuppance as part of seth's " false witness . "  only courteney cox strikes a note of reality in a solid performance ; she is sane center around which too equally troubled men revolve .  even she can't force taplitz to decide whose story this is , or what we should have learned about dealing with the struggles in our lives and our relationship with the infinite .  by the time seth makes a singularly biblical reappearance late in the film , it has become clear that taplitz is aiming for a fantastical fable which makes no connection with real human experience .  commandments is a bad comedy which could have been a decent drama if daniel taplitz had had the guts to take faith -- and the loss thereof -- at all seriously .

neg	i admit it .  i thought arnold schwarzenegger had a knack for comedy when he made twins and true lies .  watching him in jingle all the way , i wondered why anyone ever thought he could carry such a lame movie targeted at susceptible kids .  it was one thing to scare the crap out of kids with the pg-13 kindergarten cop , but parents who let small children see this movie will have to explain themes of violence , alcohol consumption , burglary , racism and child molestation .  and you know they'll burst out in tears when arnold punches one of santa's elves .  he later decks a reindeer .  hey , man , why don't you just kick the easter bunny in the nuts while you're at it ?  jingle all the way is formula crap that follows the if someone falls on his ass , it must be funny school of thought .  arnold , sinbad and phil hartman crash to the ground more times in this movie than a special olympics hockey team , and the movie dredges up more cliche and less believability with each successive scene .  what can you expect from a movie whose entire premise is that two parents can't find a rare toy on christmas eve , and will do anything to get one ?  arnold is , of course , one of the parents , a crack salesman who is never there for his son .  he races from the office to his son's karate game , only to find out he missed it .  and his kid distrusts him because he's never around .   ( gee , we haven't seen that in a movie before . )  arnold the absentee father becomes convinced that the only way to buy back his son's affection is to get him a turboman doll , which his wife ( rita wilson , who will never be the breadwinner of the hanks household choosing roles like this ) told him to get weeks ago .  so arnold sets out to find a turboman , which turns out to be more rare than the tickle me elmo was when jingle all the way came out .  let me back up for a minute here -- arnold's kid is totally obsessed with this turboman character , which is unhealthy beyond belief .  watches the show , eats the cereal , sleeps on the freakin' turboman sheets .  i'd try to discourage any further obsession myself , lest any kid seeing this movie think it's a wonderful thing to con your dad into racing out to buy you any toy you want .  but nooooo , the climax of jingle all the way has arnold dressed up as turboman in a parade , exonerating himself of all wrongdoing in the eyes of wife and son , who don't recognize him until the last minute .  this is a sad movie all the way through , but it only gets worse after the opening scenes of arnold and mailman sinbad stampeding through a store , racing off to the mall and hooking up with a santa ( jim belushi ) who runs a bootleg toy factory .  most painful to watch is a scene at a radio station , where sinbad holds off the cops with a letter bomb after beating up the deejay ( an embarrassed martin mull ) who said he was giving away a turboman doll .  capitalism has produced some pretty evil things ( chia pets ) , but this ode to excess and violent consumerism is one of the most shameful .  never mind the subplot with perfect neighbor phil hartman trying to seduce wilson while arnold is off shopping ( " your cookies are incredible " ) , it's the main plot of the movie that sends the message that it's okay to do whatever it takes to get your hands on what you want .  maybe that's what christmas is like at the schwarzenegger house , but not at mine .

neg	the title is taken from the writings of ralph waldo emerson describing the life of a traveler as 'anywhere but here . '  there isn't one thing about this mother-daughter relationship melodrama that felt honest .  it relies on a contrived minor character to tell both mother and daughter what was obvious to do in order to straighten out their dysfunctional lives , as for some reason they couldn't figure it out for themselves .  if the film looks familiar , that is because " the slums of beverly hills ( 98 ) " went over the same ground but was fortunate to be more comical and perceptive due to alan arkin and natasha lyonne performances , in which they were fortunate to have a much sharper script to work with .  alvin sargent's script was weak and annoyingly claustral .  wayne wang's ( " the joy luck club " ) inept direction made a weak script even weaker by his inability to tell the story unfolding without the voiceover relating what the action couldn't convey .  pushy mother adele august ( susan sarandon ) forces her 14-year-old daughter ann ( natalie portman ) to leave a small midwestern burg to go cross-country with her to beverly hills .  the daughter resents her twice divorced , unstable but exotic , schoolteacher mother , bullying her to be an actress as a means of escaping a humdrum life .  the daqughter doesn't even like the used gold mercedes mother buys to drive to lala land in and can't stand the beach boys records mom enjoys hearing on the car radio .  so it becomes a question of who knows best , as the ladies fight it out between them , until the predictable sweet ending comes in this yawner .  adele's dream of greener pastures in beverly hills soon doesn't look that good , as she lands a job in a slum school , has her precious car scratched by the unruly kids , and settles into a job she hates in order to financially survive .  daughter pines for small town wisconsin and her friends there .  during one of many arguments with her free-spirited mom , they go for ice cream and while mother is being ticketed , she runs away , only to be chased down by friendly traffic cop ( michael milhoan ) , who offers her wise counsel .  with the cop's zen wisdom passed onto the daughter , she will survive living in many different addresses in beverly hills until she reaches 17 and then she plans to get way from mom by using her good grades to go to brown university instead of ucla .  during their stay in beverly hills , she grows from feeling awkward in beverly hills high to immediately having many high school girlfriends and even a high school rich boy admirer-- a t . s .  eliot ( corbin allred ) reader .  but the transition of her life into beverly hills had no feel of reality , as everything seemed staged and unemotional .  when she learns her cousin benny ( shawn hatosy ) , who happens to be her best friend dies in a traffic accident back in wisconsin , she returns for the funeral and in those reunion scenes it wasn't clearly shown why she wants to stay there , and for that matter , it was never made clear why the mother wants to leave so badly .  the film is one big battle of wills between mother and daughter over their dreams .  i guess what the filmmaker is trying to say , is that mom is a bad dreamer and the daughter is the observant one , able to recognize mother's faults when not in growing pains and in need of parenting herself .  mother has a series of setbacks , like being dumped by her dream-boat dentist ( bochner ) she met on the beach , and witnessing her daughter mimic her whiny optimistic sayings when trying out for an acting part .  but mother learns that her daughter has grown-up and is independent and that she has to stop living her life through her .  she learns this when the same wise cop who told ann what to do , is about to ticket her and this time will remind the mother of the right thing to do .  this of course results in the corny ending , showing that mom's heart was always in the right place , only she went about it in the wrong way .  this was just one of those films where you want to be anywhere but in the theater where this film is showing .

neg	when i first saw the preview for cruel intentions , i turned to my friend and said , " dangerous liaisons for kids ! "  it was clear to me that the film would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense , owing everything it is to stephen frears' 1988 masterpiece .  imagine my surprise to see that writer/director roger kumble has given credit to his source material : choderlos de laclos is recognized for his novel les liaisons dangereuses in the opening credits .  and i was impressed .  in fact , i was much more impressed with this recognition than with the actual film , which is an appalling excuse for a movie .  it's kiddie-porn hackwork , complete with earthy sex-talk and fully-clothed hand-jobs .  i suppose this kind of movie was inevitable ; with all the teen high-school angst movies coming out , there was certainly room for a pretentious and laughable movie about a bunch of teenagers who think they're smarter and more beautiful than all the other people on earth combined .  cruel intentions is a mess in every possible way , and it fails primarily in the way i expected it to : i hated all the characters , and i hate everything they do .  i also hate ryan phillippe , so perhaps my opinion is not as objective as it could be .  phillippe plays ( check out this name ) sebastian valmont .  wow .  isn't that a memorable name ?  i could just say it over and over again .  sebastian valmont .  it kind of rolls off the tongue , in the spirit of phrases like sanguine vapors and velvet sandwich .  sebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth ; there is no woman he can't have , no material object out of his reach .  he has all the money , all the sex -- all at his fingertips .  and , luckily , his parents never enter into his life -- no , in the world of cruel intentions , adults don't really exist .  the ones who do are irritating .  sebastian valmont lives with his stepsister , kathryn merteuil ( sarah michelle gellar ) , the bitch-queen of the universe , and also the woman every man wants .  since these two rich kids are so bored , they only thing they can do is challenge each other with meaningless sexual liaisons .  kathryn wants sebastian valmont to de-virginize cecile caldwell ( selma blair ) , a naive dork-chick who has somehow wronged kathryn .  but it's too easy for sebastian valmont -- he wants to nail annette hargrove ( reese witherspoon ) , the " paradigm of chastity and beauty . "  so , sebastian valmont and kathryn make a deal ( which is too explicit to state here ) .  but -- dear god !  -- sebastian valmont actually begins to fall for poor annette hargrove .  dangerous liaisons is a great movie because the characters are all believable , and because of its masterful acting .  cruel intentions is bad for many reasons , but it lacks both believable characters and masterful acting .  kathryn merteuil is simply a hateful witch , a girl so loathsome that i would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her .  she is supposed to be mean , but glenn close gave the character some depth in dangerous liaisons .  gellar , while aesthetically pleasing , is one-dimensional and utterly repulsive .  witherspoon has a truly beautiful face , but her character isn't the moral staple she's supposed to be : sure , she won't have sex until she's in love ( is this really a * moral * issue ? ) , but she does some things in the last few scenes that are more than a little reprehensible .  but i can't forget mr . phillippe , who continues to exceed my expectations with his impenetrable , invulnerable blandness .  i have to give him credit and say that he did , in fact , manage to change his facial expression about three times during the course of cruel intentions .  and there's one point in the film in which he shouts , thereby defeating my hypothesis that he is vocally monotone .  true , he is bad , but it doesn't help that he has no character to work with .  kumble has drained all the interesting aspects from this character , leaving us with a sex-crazed lunatic who is supposed to be sympathetic because he falls in love with a moral flower and shuns the wicked bitch .  the film fails in every other way , too .  first of all , nobody talks like this .  even the " intellectuals " i know don't bother with this kind of pointless and pretentious yammering .  for a while , the movie looks like it might play itself for laughs , but it ends up taking itself so seriously that there's no way we can join it .  cruel intentions also manages to come off as soft-porn in more than one scene .  earlier i mentioned a fully-clothed hand-job ; this occurs between kathryn and sebastian valmont , both of whom are intended to be hateful at this point in the movie .  so , if we hate them , then what's the point of an extended sex scene ?  titillation , of course .  it can't even work under the pretense of " meaningful love scene , " because we hate the characters .  it's interesting to note some of the parallels between cruel intentions and dangerous liaisons .  kumble is clearly familiar with the earlier film ; many of the scenes have a similar tone , and there are moments in frears' film that kumble imitates almost completely ( such as the last scene , in which [spoiler warning ! ] the antagonist is humiliated in front of her peers ) .  but kids don't act like this .  nobody acts like this .  in his translation , roger kumble forgot character development and sympathy -- some pretty crucial elements .  the result is a picture of confounding badness , a kiddie-porn mess that thinks it's really deep and profound .  i'll give cruel intentions credit for realizing its influences , but that doesn't change the fact that it's awful .

neg	the happy bastard's quick movie review  holy man  more like holy crap .  the film stars eddie murphy as a mystical-ish figure named g on a strange journey of some sort when he comes across two network execs ( jeff goldblum and kelly preston ) with a flat tire on their hands .  somehow he ends up in their car and on their channel , a line-up of infomercial programs featuring the likes of betty white , morgan fairchild , and a slew of other celebrities and nameless figures .  it's here that he seems to hit his stride , speaking of life instead and somehow boosting sales .  at this point in the movie , of course , morality comes into play , particularly on goldblum , who suddenly feels he can market the magical g into megabucks to get in good with his boss ( robert loggia ) .  it doesn't take long for the movie to unfold into sappy mush , with realizations taking place left and right and poor plot points .  only a real zippy sequence involving frying morgan fairchild's face seems to have any interest in the movie .  murphy lends nothing to his character and poor goldblum looks as if he'd rather be someplace else .  some may argue that the movie has a message , but all that came across to me is that i could probably get more entertainment watching that informercial with the guy in the question mark coat .  at least he has something for us to laught at . . .

neg	 " virus " is the type of cliched , vacuous film that has been recylcled so many times before that you wonder why anyone would even bother putting work into making it .  strangely enough , on the same mid-january weekend last year , another film was released like this , " deep rising , " about an ugly monster on a cruise liner .  prior movies with the almost exact same storyline include 1989's " leviathan , " 1989's " deep star six , " and all four " alien " pictures .   " virus , " in comparison , is a servicable thriller , well-made and produced , but since it doesn't include one moment of even remote originality or intelligence , it sinks under the weight of the water that the film was shot on .  based on a series of comic books , " virus " concerns the crew of an ocean salvage tugboat , which becomes extremely damaged during a violent typhoon .  after discovering that the boat is slowly sinking , ( un ) lucky for them , a huge ocean vessel that appears to be dead in the water turns up within the confines of their radar screen .  once the team reaches the russian ship , they go on board to find that the place is seemingly deserted .  after turning the power back on , however , there gradually are signs that something else is on the ship , and the electrical equipment is oddly working by itself .  one survivor finally does turn up , nadia ( joanna pacula ) , who informs the suicidal and stern captain ( donald sutherland ) and one of the crew , kit foster ( jamie lee curtis ) , that a mysterious alien life form hit the santi mir space station which then was transported down to the ship , taking over the minds of all of the electrical machines and thinking that humans are viruses that should be completely wiped out .  if " virus " sounds like all of the previously mentioned movies , you're correct .  although the technical artistry is fairly impressive to bring the mechanical creature to life , the film itself doesn't appear to have a brain in its head .  the film sticks so close to the worn-out conventions of the " creature " genre that it is amazing anyone would spend the money and time filming it when they could be making an original film .  the actors are all very good and have all proven their acting abilities in the past , but they are sorely wasted here and do not really even have characters to play .  in her second return to horror in the last year , jamie lee curtis once again proves to be a strong and resourceful heroine , but that is about it .  although 1998's " halloween : h20 " was also a disappointment , at least she was given a few scenes to develop a character , unlike here .  donald sutherland has fallen on hard times recently by starring in thoroughly disposable films , such as 1994's " the puppet masters , " although i just watched him in the superb 1978 sci-fi classic " invasion of the body snatchers , " where he was fabulous .  the last of the three top-billers is william baldwin , but it is fairly hard to say if he is good or not in the picture , since he has nothing to do .  basically , " virus " is another one of those films where a group of people walk around and investigate a space ship/ocean liner/haunted house until the deadly and equally grotesque and slimy creature pops up and kills them one-by-one .  it is not the worst of its type , but it is far from one of the best , and when exactly are studios going to give up recycling such shameless and overdone plot gimmicks such as this ?  as long as some of them keep making money , i suspect the answer is never .  
pos	in the old commercial for blank audio cassettes , the tag line was " is it real or is it memorex ?

" what follows is a court martial in which - thanks to the talosians - we learn why it was so important ( besides the obvious paralysis ) for capt . pike to get to talos iv even at risk of mr. spock 's death . the illusions the talosians create , the background music and the entire storyline are fantastic . and meg wyllie as the keeper ( the head talosian ) is wonderful . call me sexist but it never occurred to me to have a woman in that role but she was perfect ! the talosians , having given up almost all physical activity and becoming almost completely reliant upon the power of illusion , are also unisex ; you ca n't really tell if they 're male or female and it really does n't matter . this episode , more than almost any other in the series , makes me hope and pray there are other worlds out there and that there are civilizations that are so far advanced ! what a neat thing if this were so ! this is one of my favorite episodes and , no matter how many times i 've seen it ( i even have it on video ) , it never fails to fascinate me . meg wyllie looks like an alien and i do not mean that unkindly .

' )  the audience was in stitches .  there are many good things about this sequel .  dr . evil is now assisted by mini-me ( verne troyer ) , a pint-sized clone who is the result of an experiment gone awry .  mini-me is the most perfect new character that any fan could ask for , and troyer does a terrific job of mimicking everything that his big brother does , pinkie and all .  mindy sterling returns as frau farbissina , evil's loud-mouth assassin sidekick , and here we are treated to a brief romantic liaison between the two in an underground bedroom chamber .  this works surprisingly well .  afterward , there's even a meeting at the coffee machine , where their awkwardness is expressed in a scene you would expect in any normal office environment .  oh , yes . . .  the plot .  after a short honeymoon with vanessa kensington ( elizabeth hurley ) that goes disastrously wrong , powers is back on the case to thwart the diabolical plans of dr . evil .  in the original , the subject of the day was cryogenic freezing that enabled the characters to hop between two time periods .  here , it's time travel .  dr . evil has this crazy plan to steal austin's mojo ( the source of his sexual powers ) , so he jumps through a time portal back into 1969 when powers is still is his freezing chamber .  there , he employs a grotesque 600-pound scottish assassin named fat bastard ( also myers ) to commandeer the mojo , so that our future hero is left completely shagless .  meanwhile , austin is informed of evil's wrong-doing by basil exposition ( michael york ) , and is supplied with his very own time-traveling device in the form of a volkswagen beetle .  once back in 1969 , powers meets a foxy cia operative named felicity shagwell ( heather graham ) , and learns of dr . evil's plans to destroy washington dc with a lazer on the moon .  in one of the many uproarious jabs at star wars , evil calls the moon base a `death star' .  if there ever was a movie that knew from the start it was a complete joke , it's austin powers : the spy who shagged me .  ap2 has many hilarious moments , much more so , than the original austin powers .  but what it doesn't have is the confident support system that the first boasted , and the jokes are now more scattershot and hit-and-miss .  while myers has a knack for delivering clever , inspired gags , he sometimes doesn't know when to call it quits .  the hilarious scene in the original involving mustafa ( will ferrell ) and his refusal to die is played out here in a disappointing and tired manner .  robert wagner , as dr . evil's #2 man , has only one scene early on in the film , where he lacks all the focus of the character .  one nice surprise is rob lowe , as the young #2 , who patterns wagner's voice and movements right down to a tee .  there are more recycled jokes from the predecessor , including kristen johnston as ivana humpalot ( an unfunny rendition of alotta fagina ) .  but myers has clearly put so much dedication into this project , and many bits are side-splittingly funny .  don't miss an extended visual gag in a tent , where the shadows leave much to the imagination . . . .  of the new characters , graham doesn't leave much of an impression .  her performance is merely okay , and she lacks the gung-ho enthusiasm that made elizabeth hurley so enjoyable before her .  and as for fat bastard . . .  well , he provides one or two hilarious moments , but all of the obesity jokes and bathroom talk go too far .  but my most severe complaint : mr . bigglesworth was only in one scene ! !  but , with gritted teeth , i managed to get over that .  this sequel will not leave fans disappointed ; it's more often than not a laugh riot .  and , i look optimistically to the future , where i foresee more installments to the austin powers collection .  if myers can up the quota of fresh ideas , we should be in store for much more .

neg	 . . . a weak and ineffective ghost story without a conclusion or pay off . 
neg	there is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom , surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strong-worded attack on a group of stoic doctors .  when i noticed that the audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way , i realized that i was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture .  you see , patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries .  i hated this movie for every second that i sat watching it , and i actively hate it now , days later , with the simpering , superficial , nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories .  i hate every element of the film , beginning with tom shadyac's shameless direction , and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey .  the badness of patch adams is stupefying .  it's confounding .  i can't believe a film can be this bad .  and yet , it's based on a real man who probably has a good point to make .  in the film , patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams , in a performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human .  in the beginning of the film , patch commits himself to a mental institution because he doesn't want to kill himself .  while there , he notices that the doctors don't care about the patients , and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings .  so , patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients .  he goes to medical school , where he meets truman ( daniel london ) and convinces him that it's good to help people .  he also meets carin fischer ( monica potters ) , the anti-male med student who just wants to go through the motions and be a successful doctor .  naturally , the dean of the medical school ( bob gunton ) hates patch , and wants to thwart his plans , even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams .  so patch decides that he's going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have .  and that , my friends , is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998 .  on a superficial level , the film is not particularly bad : i wouldn't say the cinematography bothered me , and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for ( i actually liked potter's performance , even if she is wasted ) .  but the film fails fundamentally in execution .  every scene swells with grand , " emotional " music , played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard .  take , for instance , the first scene , which shows patch sitting on a bus .  we don't know patch yet , but there's sad music , and it's supposed to make us really sad that he's sad .  later on , patch makes a lot of progress : he helps a dying patient ( peter coyote ) to enjoy the last days of his life , and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively .  and when that patient finally dies ( spoiler alert ! ) , the music is very very sad .  but the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions .  real drama is character-based .  you grow to like someone , and then something bad happens , and you feel it .  we don't ever grow to know the dying patient ; he's simply a vehicle for patch's greatness .  real drama doesn't seem forced , or present just to make the audience cry .  that's why patch adams is not real drama .  it goes for every cheap tear imaginable , wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene .  even scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaiman's sickening musical score .  sentimentality like this is indeed bad .  but it's not as bad as half-baked , simplistic themes .  you see , patch is a really great student .  he aces his tests without studying , and does it so effectively that people think he's cheating .  but patch doesn't think that memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor .   " why don't we see patients until the third year ? " he bursts out every three seconds .  well , patch , that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients .  not everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort .  most of us have to study .  and a doctor who really wants to help , but doesn't know a toe from a finger , probably won't be too successful in preventing death .  oh wait , i almost forgot : the point of doctors is not just to " prevent death , " but to " improve the quality of life ! "  yes !  that is true !  and you can not do that without studying .  you can not do that without going to medical school .  what patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe , just maybe , it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later .  follow the rules ?  bah !  who needs the rules !  only uptight doctors follow the rules .  the real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants .  and then there's the free clinic issue , which i find shockingly , frighteningly idealistic .  a free clinic .  in the middle of the forest .  where patients can be taken to be helped .  for free .  how will patients be transported to the free clinic ?  will it have an emergency room ?  or is it just for mental patients ?  and who , may i ask , will pay for it ?  the film does give some token attempts to question patch's motives ( i think another character asks him how he's going to pay for it , in addition to a little bit of meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance ) , but they certainly don't explore or challenge patch's ideas to any meaningful extent .  reader , please understand this : i am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams .  i know nothing about him .  if his beliefs mirror those of this film character , then i might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them .  but regardless of what the real patch adams believes , the themes put forth in this film are simplistic and phony .  and in the last scene , the big , obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus , patch does a lot of shouting .  actually , robin williams does a lot of shouting .  he shouts a lot about helping people , and a lot of people cry because they are moved by his words .  i won't tell you that you can't be moved by his words , because i , too , was moved by his words .  i was moved in such a profoundly negative way that i was reminded of how cheap and phony a cinematic experience can be .  patch adams is the cheapest of them all .  
neg	chill factor is a carbon copy of speed with one notable exception : instead of a speeding bus , we now have an ice cream truck .  the truck is driven by arlo ( cuba gooding jr . ) and mason ( skeet ulrich ) , who have been instructed by a dying scientist to transport a deadly chemical weapon to a military base by the name of fort mcgruder .  this particular weapon ( nicknamed `elvis' ) must be kept below a temperature of 50 degrees , or else the shockwave will goo-iffy everything in a mile radius .  that would be pretty nasty .  the power of elvis is revealed in the opening scene , as dr . richard long ( david paymer ) conducts a test on an isolated tropical island .  long accidentally melts 18 soldiers and defoliates virtually the entire island , due to an enormously miscalculated safety distance .  the commanding officer , general brynner ( peter firth ) , is sentenced to 10 years in prison for the murder of his troops .  upon his release , the general is intent on tracking the good doctor down , snatching elvis , and selling the weapon to the highest international bidder .  protecting the fate of the world is a drifting hamburger flipper ( ulrich ) and a feisty ice cream delivery man ( gooding jr . ) , who must elude brynner's men and get elvis to safety at fort mcgruder .  all the while , of course , they must keep the weapon below 50 degrees .  this proves to be tricky .  among the wild adventures arlo and mason partake in is a trip down a tree-covered mountainside in a boat , and a fist fight on top of a moving vehicle .  they also crack a few dozen witty retorts that we are supposed to find amusing .  to put it simply , i'll use a clever pun : chill factor should be put on ice .  director hugh johnson has mixed elements from speed , broken arrow and the lethal weapon series to create a lifelessly bland cocktail of a chase movie .  when there is some occasional action , the audience seems oddly detached from it .  perhaps that's because we've already waded through a pool of clich ? s and boring dialogue ; all material that's been used before , and with a lot more spice .  take the villains , for example .  they are typical stereotypes of every terrorist that has ever walked the silver screen .  they speak lines that have been recycled profusely from one movie to the next , divulge important plot details while holding their enemies at gunpoint , and act in very predictable ways .  the tag-team of gooding jr . and ulrich sounds much more exciting than it is .  frankly , i'm not sure i can accept cuba as an ice cream man .  i suppose it's better than him dressed like a giant hot dog , selling jumbo frankfurters on a street corner .  gooding displays one single emotion in this movie , which is frequently on display in lines like `i'm gonna get on yo ass like last year's underwear ! ' and the incessant sputtering of `oh , sh * t ! '  this is virtually the same character he played in jerry maguire and as good as it gets .  but where gooding was once an exciting actor , he now seems dull and endlessly monotonous .  at least he's a bit more captivating than ulrich , who has all the film's worst dialogue , but does nothing noticeable to enliven his character .  the supporting cast , which includes every personality you expect to pop up , is also wasted .  to be fair , there are a few brief moments of serviceable action .  and i did chuckle a few times .  one example is when ulrich ( an employee at `darlene's diner' ) is at the counter when brynner walks through the door .  `you own this place ? '  the general asks .  `yeah , ' ulrich says .  `they call me darlene . '  these little tidbits of humor are ( mainly ) welcome in this weak , disappointing wreckage of an action film .  as a speed clone , it could have benefited from a lot more suspense and perhaps ( god forbid ) even some decent writing .  sadly , i walked away from chill factor only wondering how much fun it could have been .

pos	no worse a film than breaking out , and breaking out was utterly charming . 
pos	the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do .  lives are often at stake , and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable , prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment's notice .  the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor , psychologist , and sham artist , in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence , or failing that , must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower .  most of all , the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible , and quickly gain control of the situation , dominate the conversation , and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants .  it takes a pretty smart person to do that .  but what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ?  what if he's also able to think on his feet ?  in fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ?  it is this circumstance which forms the basis for f . gary gray's the negotiator .  in this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l . jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force .  when his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman's home , roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder .  faced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain's office .  i don't quite remember if the captain actually said , " i hate to do this , but . . . " ,  although it wouldn't surprise me if he did .  luckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above .  after being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney , roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j . t .  walsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming he has been framed .  although roman's actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up , gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue .  jackson , while a superb actor , is miscast in the role of roman .  the actor has become so popular , and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found , such as in jackie brown ) , that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats .  the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence .  how can we believe he's going to shoot a hostage , no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ?  unfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it's would-be suspenseful moments , and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson's acting ability .  almost every time he's in a scene , jackson steals it without looking back .  when spacey appears , the film has already run about a third of its course .  his is an interesting character .  made out to be some kind of negotiating superman , our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation .   " i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower , but i can't talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone , " he says .  when he gets the call to action , however , he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be .  soon , his character has to negotiate not only with roman , but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out , all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation , should negotiations fail .  this complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor .  as the second protagonist , spacey measures up nicely .  gray really lucked out with this cast .  david morse as commander beck , ron rifkin as commander frost , and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent , and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey .  the only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock , rifkin played the d . a .  in l . a . confidential , and spencer played a police detective in cop land .  with the level of acting , however , this can be forgiven .  also in the supporting cast , paul giamatti as rudy , one of the hostages , is notable for the comic relief he provides .  his character is initially so slimy , and giamatti himself just looks so shifty , that you expect to laugh before he even says anything .  fortunately , this doesn't distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film , but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout .  j . t . walsh , as the suspicious internal affairs inspector , clocks in with one of his final performances .  sadly , the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year , and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film .  walsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam , backdraft , and nixon .  for one of his best performances , check out sling blade , in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton .  when jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march , walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success ( the actors performed together in a few good men ) .  the negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh , and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role , it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing .  in the end , the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it's reality .  we're served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best .  as an audience , we're also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie , and we'd like to see if one will dominate the film .  both provide some pretty good entertainment .

neg	a slight romantic comedy with a feminist bent , but one with no edge to it .  it turns out to be a conventional film filled with the usual clich ? s and stock characters of this genre .  though it's a well-written and well-acted fluff piece , it still does not have too much to say that is surprising .  it's made for the gentle art-house set , those who don't want something too disturbing to think about .  it's about a critically successful writer husband , alec ( pryce ) , who is so self-absorbed that he's threatened by his department store floor-walking model wife , kate ( bouquet ) , who wants to be a writer .  she meets his crass publisher , vanni corso ( walken ) , another self-absorbed man , and a predictable relationship occurs .  the fireworks occur because she outgrows her husband's first impressions of her as someone who was impressed with his genius and worships at his feet .  she now wants her own identity and her independence .  the film looked like the usual sitcom stuff , and is plagued with the cheap set design features reserved for a tv movie .  the film sagged in the middle of the story from the weight of its tedium , and eventually landed on its rear end with its unspectacular climax .  it's set in london , and it opens as model kate rebuffs sexual advances by a wealthy american shopper , vanni .  she later meets him as her hubby's new upstart publisher who seeks to have her intellectual author husband in his stable in order to give him credibility as a publisher of quality , and he quickly wins favor with her by publishing her vanity novel .  alec who is an obnoxious grouse , someone whom it seems it would be impossible to live with , tries to do everything to stop his wife from having her book published--which only pushes her into the grasping arms of vanni .  the publisher is proud that he's a mamma's boy who never married and is a self-made man who has earned millions .  he has recently acquired a failing old london publishing house and plans to revitalize it , as he proudly tells kate : " if my father could sell pizzas in harlem , i could sell culture in europe . "  the only thing that couldn't be sold , is this stiff story and tired plot line .  the mystery to me , is how the lovely kate could like either man unless she was an insensitive dummy .  she soon divorces the beleaguered alec and marries the soon-to-become-beleaguered vanni .  when she writes a second novel , he rebuffs her the same way her first hubby did .  it ends with the same results that happened to hubby number one , as its story of ambition and lust winds down in a whimper .  a business affair was loosely based on the real-life literary and romantic travails of married authors barbara skelton and cyril connolly , in their celebrated 1950s love triangle .  
pos	notice : this is a review and analysis of exotica .  the first part of this piece is the review , the second part contains some analysis of the movie which might be construed as spoilers .  if you have not seen the movie and after reading the first part you intend to do so , then save the second part for the discussion afterwards .  starring : bruce greenwood , mia kirshner , elias kosteas , don mckellar , arsinee khanijian , sarah polley director : atom egoyan screenplay : atom egoyan  exotica is a film that grows on retrospection .  exotica keeps the viewer guessing about the relationship between the various characters in the film .  all of the people know each other , but apart from that , there seems to be no other reason why to select such set and follow them in this fictional account .  the director hints for possible solutions , using a multi-line plot , so popular with critics in mystery train , and used to good advantage by quentin tarantino in pulp fiction .  exotica reaches a whole new dimension using this technique .  at the end it is surprising to see how well the pieces of the puzzle fit together , in spite their apparent unconnectedness and even misleading features .  the out-of-chronological-order technique has become ever so popular , perhaps even de rigueur , for biographical films .  similarly , we can now expect to see more movies in the future which will use , to varying extent , converging multiplots .  on a first glance , once the multi-plot puzzle in exotica is solved , there seems to be little left to look at .  but perceptive minds which take the time to dig further will be rewarded with interesting views on life or rather , commentaries on views of life .  exotica is very much worth seeing .  it opened to critic's praise worldwide ( i first saw it in mexico city , last december ) .  in canada , it broke records for a movie of its kind , which prompted the american distributor to go for a wide release .  apart from a strong plot , acting is very convincing , and the soundtrack seems as if made for the movie .  the spoon-fed-entertainment crowd may not appreciate this movie , and thus it might last little on screen .  but if you want to try a movie a cut above the crowd , with an originality that is ever so rare , by all means see exotica .  analysis ( * * spoilers * * ahead )  what is behind the complex plot in exotica ?  first , a common theme of the quest for gratification by monetary means .  the lone tax-auditor , the repressed homosexual pet shop owner , the pregnant woman which runs the nightclub , the rich man which has the club remodeled , the audience at the movie theatre , all use personal wealth to buy palliative relief for the penuries of the soul . . . .  then we have the quest for gratification through visual means by most of the same people , including those who sit watching exotica . . . .  in that regard exotica stands for onlookers at a nightclub , for the rich man looking through silver mirrors , and poor-rich people looking at other's people lives through a silver screen .  exotica also stands for unwanted society attention into the lives of other people , such as the tax auditor and the pet shop owner .  exotica is the customer agent looking at the pet shop owner , which in turn is looking at the core of the problems between the strip dancer and the tax auditor through the detached eye of a gay person ( no attraction to the strip dancer ) , and only interested on avoiding jail ( no personal relationship with the tax auditor ) .  in exotica everybody is watching , and what is worse , everybody knows .  second , exotica is about isolated people holding back their feelings ; about people which by voluntary or involuntary means transfer their view of reality to other characters .  the strip dancer becomes the proverbial daughter , the dj becomes the proverbial killer by means of breaking the relationship between the father and the proverbial daughter .  the niece becomes the baby sitter , the baby sitter becomes the dancer , and the dancer becomes the proverbial daughter .  the pet shop owner becomes the proverbial dj , by finding the proverbial daughter .  a chain made of real and imagined links coming around full circle , just as everything comes around to a fitting whole at the end of the movie .

" she doesn't do any actual writing , " he is told , " but inspires you . "  steven is excited by what he's hearing and asks jack to call her up to see if she'll take steven on as a new client .  jack arranges a meeting between the two and suggests that steven bring her a present , preferably something from tiffany's .  after the meeting the muse , sarah decides to take on steven , but at a price : she wants a suite at the four seasons and wants steven to perform odd tasks for her ( like bringing her salads in the middle of the night . )  steven's wife ( andy macdowell ) sees him at a food store and questions him about why he has tampons in his wagon .  steven confesses everything and , although at first suspicious , she later allows sarah to move into their guest room and eventually into their life .  the only question for steven is if the muse is worth all the trouble he's going through for her .  and that's a question only time will tell .   " the muse " is albert brooks' sixth film as writer/director/actor ( he co-wrote with monica johnson ) and although it's a good movie it's not up to the level of his best works ( " defending your life " and " mother " ) .  the problem lies in the script , and for a movie that relies on its dialogue for its humor , there aren't nearly as many laughs as they are chuckles despite a few good one-liners .  it has a great premise but doesn't deliver up to it's full potential .  but , i like albert brooks in this film and i think that we can all identify with steven phillips a little bit .  he may whine and complain , but he just wants to support his family and be happy .  and i like sharon stone in this movie too ; it's a nice change of pace for her .  and i also enjoyed the cameos featuring the likes of rob reiner , james cameron and martin scorsese .  and although " the muse " doesn't have as much to say about hollywood as robert altman's " the player " i still left the theater feeling good .  and that's something i wish i got out of more movies .

neg	one of the contributors to the destruction of the batman film franchise chris o'donnell stars in this remake of buster keaton's 1925 silent film seven chances .  now i've never seen seven chances , as i'm more of a chaplin fan than a keaton fan , but i seriously doubt that the classic version could be as insipid as this .  o'donnell plays jimmie shannon , the manager of a pool table manufacturing company .  he also fears commitment , and despite dating anne ( renee zellweger ) for over three years , he's unwilling to marry her .  his reasons ?  well he's a guy you see , and well , guys are like stallions , and they apparently don't like to be roped or something ( hey , that's the movie's explanation . . .  i'd marry renee zellweger in a second ) .  eventually it comes time for jimmie to propose , and when he does , it's the most absurd proposal ever uttered by a man ever .  he essentially says to her , " you win " and hands her a ring .  the audience should now hate this character .  i did .  then the meat of the plot presents itself .  jimmie's grandfather ( peter ustinov , completely wasted ) dies and leaves jimmie his entire estate of 100 million dollars as well as ownership of the pool table business .  however , in order to get the money and save the jobs of the factory workers , jimmie must be married before his next birthday ( which is just over 24 hours away ) .  having blown his chances with anne , jimmie proceeds to track down all his prior girlfriends and suggest a " business proposition " .  the movie wasn't half bad by this time , surprisingly .  it wasn't boring me , and even managed to read my thoughts at one point .  ustinov's character left a video will , and while he's reading the ridiculous clause in it , i thought to myself " what is this , brewster's millions ? " .  as soon as i thought it , hal holbrook's character actually says " what is this , brewster's millions ? "  it was quite surreal .  something happens though during the film's final act that caused me to sharply drop the rating it was going to receive .  up to that point , all of jimmie's prior girlfriends had turned down his " business proposition " which i felt was good .  at least the film wasn't painting women to be cold hearted gold diggers .  when jimmie has no other options , his goofy friend ( played by artie lange , making a career out of playing the goofy friend ) places an ad in the newspaper that somehow becomes a front page story .  at this point , 100 , 000 women don wedding gowns and head off to persuade jimmie to pick them to be his bride .  these women arrive at jimmie's location and immediately start bullying him about what he's looking for in a woman .  when he's had enough of their unjustified attacks , he tells the angry mob that there's been a mistake and he won't be marrying any of them .  as a result , the women proceed to chase him around the city , in hopes of catching him and tearing his limbs off .  this goes on for the rest of the film .  it's just chris o'donnell running from 100 , 000 obnoxious , greedy , angry and stupid women .  my groans of disgust could be heard for miles .  the film finally ended ( thankfully ) , but to this day i'm still groaning .  the bachelor is available on dvd from new line home video .  it contains the film in both full frame and in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , cast and crew info , and special dvd-rom features .  the original theatrical trailer is also on the disc , which contains scenes not in the film .  apparently there was even more footage of the gang of brides chasing o'donnell around the city , and at one point o'donnell is leaping from the tops of buses .  so that was bad enough to be cut , but the other 30 minutes of bride shenanigans was good ?  ugh .

neg	have you ever been in an automobile accident where you've miraculously walked away with only a few scratches , yet the car has been obliterated into an unrecognizable , mangled wreck ?  well , that has never actually happened to me and i hope that none of us will ever experience this situation .  but after watching this inane exercise of a movie , i certainly feel that i've miraculously walked away unscathed after a two-hour ride that mercilessly careens back and forth before finally plummeting into an icy pond .  oddly , `eye of the beholder , ' which is a psychological-romance-thriller , starts off promisingly enough when the opening sequence introduces us to a british intelligence agent , called the eye ( ewan mcgregor ) , working in washington dc .  in the humorous opening scene , he eyes a top lawyer across the street in his office with his pants down .  using an array of high-tech surveillance and communications equipment , he proceeds to transmit pictures of the bared lawyer to pc screens and fax machines in his office .  the law firm's employees get a good chuckle .  the audience gets a good chuckle .  the eye is later given an assignment where he encounters a beautiful woman ( ashley judd ) .  there is something compelling about this mysterious woman .  despite her glamorous looks , however , we learn that she is a psychopath with a propensity to kill men that get too close to her .  after the murders , she sobs while singing the christmas tune `little bluebirds' and laments about being abandoned by her father long ago .  after each killing , she puts on a different wig , assumes a new name , and then makes her way to another state .  the eye has witnessed all her murderous transgressions .  but he does not alert the authorities .  he somehow empathizes with her sense of loss .  the eye , it turns out , also is haunted by his past .  his daughter was taken away from him and he anguishes this loss every day of his life .  his tormented psyche creates a ghost-like image of his daughter with which he engages in conversation .  she becomes a sort of spectral adviser , and one thing that the ghostly daughter says is that he must help the woman .  he now diverts his energies into trying to help her find some kind of salvation .  it doesn't matter that he has witnessed all of her murders .  and it doesn't matter that the eye is abnormally reticent , hiding his entire life behind computer screens .  he follows her to a dozen different locales and shadows her every move to keep her out of trouble .  when a crazed druggie ( jason priestley ) attacks her , he shows up for some quick butt kicking .  when the police are closing in to arrest her , he provides a distraction so that she can escape .  all the while , the woman has no idea who her guardian angel is and the eye stays just out of sight .  peculiar .  how bad is this movie ?  i refer you to my `review quote source' litmus test .  just take a look at the full-page ad in the newspaper and see where they are pulling quotes .  for this movie , they are from magazines called `flaunt' and `mirabella . '  no doubt , they were impressed with judd's series of catwalks and disguise changes .  the major problem with `eye of the beholder' is that the film jerks forward , always unsure of its ultimate destination .  if it was a thriller , there was little to keep us entranced .  if it was a love story , there was absolutely no emotional pull .  completely disjointed in structure , it's only saving grace was its stylish look which reminded me of my favorite car commercial ( the one where the `6' on the tachometer dissolves into a winding road and a passenger rail car dissolves into a small miniature on a child's train set ) .  i am also still hopeful that ashley judd will find a serious role to showcase her potential talents .  beyond that , the film is hopelessly out-of-control and is in need of seriously better traction and handling .

neg	the " fab 4 " of ronald reagan high are four stuck-up girls , played by rose mcgowan , rebecca gayheart , julie benz and charlotte roldan , who overdress like 4 posh spice wannabes .  their daily ritual is to parade up and down the school halls like royalty , and their constant reflex action is to grab their compacts so they can check their make-up and powder their cheeks .  under no circumstances will they ever let themselves be seen eating in public .  in writer and director darren stein's jawbreaker , it isn't as funny as it sounds .  in fact , it isn't funny at all .  stein has taken the black comedy of a teen movie like heathers and stripped it of any intelligence , wit or charm .  his actresses toss off their lines so fast that they don't have time to add any emotion .  and all of his female characters have considerably more lipstick than brains .  the setup for the movie has one of the fab 4 , liz , who is referred to as " the princess di of reagan high , " be killed when a prank by the other 3 goes wrong .  the princess di reference is in bad taste , as is much of the movie .  granted , bad taste can sometimes be funny , but the mere presence of bad taste doesn't guarantee it .  liz's girlfriends stick a jawbreaker that is literally larger than a golf ball in her mouth , tape her mouth shut , and stick her bound body in the trunk of a car .  when they open the trunk later , liz is dead .  they eventually put her blue and bruised body into a sexual position and make it look like liz was the victim of a brutal rape .  these realistic and disgusting scenes of a dead , seminude teen have a pornographic feeling that is hard to forget and will likely turn the stomach of many a viewer .  the film's dialog not only isn't funny , it's trite .  one nerdy young girl introduces herself with " my name is fern mayo , as in hold the mayo . "  when fern discovers what has happened , the fab 3 make her an offer she can't refuse -- make-up !  they cake it on her and welcome her to the clan .  the parents in the movie brag about learning parenting skills from watching oprah .  the teachers fare no better , especially in the ridiculous lines they are given .   " miss shayne , please cover your bosom , " one young teacher , who has been made up to look old and ugly , says without any conviction .   " this is a learning institution , not a brothel . "  besides the obvious question of why this movie was ever made , there is one other question that i'd like to ask the director .  why do you have a phone number start with 555 if you going to cover the rest of the number anyway ?  in a cameo , pam grier plays detective vera cruz , who investigates liz's murder .  as she interrogates the other people , she stares at them like they are all idiots , proving that she is the only one that gets it .  i am sure that if the hard nosed detective cruz were to see this movie , she'd walk out after about 5 minutes , and you'd be well advised to do the same if you should happen to find yourself in a theater showing it .  jawbreaker runs 1 : 27 .  it is rated r for violence , gore , profanity and sex .  i would advise everyone to avoid it , but if teenagers go they should be older and mature .

neg	i caught this stink bomb of a movie recently on a cable channel , and was reminded of how terrible i thought it was in 1980 when first released . many reviewers out there are n't old enough to remember the enormous hype that surrounded this movie and the struggle between stanley kubrick and steven king . the enormously popular novel had legions of fans eager to see a supposed " master " director put this multi - layered supernatural story on the screen . " salem 's lot " had already been ruined in the late 1970s as a tv mini - series , directed by tobe hooper ( he of " texas chainsaw massacre " fame ) and was badly handled , turning the major villain of the book into a " chiller theatre " vampire with no real menace at all thus destroying the entire premise . fans hoped that a director of kubrick 's stature would succeed where hooper had failed . it did n't happen . sure , this movie looks great and has a terrific opening sequence but after those few accomplishments , it 's all downhill . jack nicholson can not be anything but jack nicholson . he 's always crazy and did n't bring anything to his role here . i do n't care that many reviewers here think he 's all that in this clinker , the " here 's johnny ! " bit notwithstanding ... he 's just awful in this movie . so is everyone else , for that matter . scatman crothers ' character , dick halloran , was essential to the plot of the book , yet kubrick kills him off in one of the lamest " shock " sequences ever put on film . i remember the audience in the theater i saw this at booing repeatedly during the last 45 minutes of this wretched flick , those that stayed that is ... many left . king 's books really never translate well to film since so much of the narratives occur internally to his characters , and often metaphysically . kubrick jettisoned the tension between the living and the dead in favor of style here and the resulting mess ends so far from the original material that we ultimately do n't really care what happens to whom . this movie still stinks and why so many think it 's a horror masterpiece is beyond me .

pos	in my reviews i try to make gentle recommendations rather than telling you what to see or what not to see .  i realize that we all have different tastes and i cannot predict what my audience will like and what they will dislike .  but in the case of american beauty , i must make an exception .  if you haven't yet seen it , go see it .  now .  stop reading this review and head for your local multiplex , then after you've seen it , come back .  i'll wait here .  welcome back .  if you followed my advice ( and i see no reason why you should not have , do you ? ) ,  i'm sure you've just had one of the richest cinematic experiences of your life .  american beauty is an extraordinary film , a powerful , jolting exploration of the dark side of the american dream .  it's humorous but it isn't funny because of the unrelenting ominous undercurrent that runs throughout the whole production .  mixing comedy and the darkest of drama was the way this film was intended , and by god , it works , making it one of the year's very best .  lester burnham ( kevin spacey ) has entered the mother of all mid-life crises .  he is living life without a purpose .  he is bored , depressed and sick of his sheltered , insignificant existence .  he barely ever talks to his family , has no sex life , is stuck at a dead-end job and thinks he has no reason to live .  but one day , when he and his equally troubled wife ( annette bening ) attend one of his daughter's ( thora birch ) cheerleading performances , he sees something that makes him come alive .  what he sees is the performance by his daughter's friend , the head cheerleader .  he develops a lust for the promiscuous young girl ; an obsession which soon becomes pedophilic in nature .  but for the first time , lester feels that he is actually living .  this crush is only the beginning .  lester proceeds to make more and more radical changes in his life , buying the car of his dreams , cursing off the boss and quitting his job ( " today i quit my job , told the boss to f * * * himself and blackmailed him for $60 , 000 -- would you pass the asparagus please ? " ) ,  buying drugs from the voyeur-next-door ( ricky fitts , a teenager who mysteriously videotapes what he considers to be " beauty " ) and refusing to be docile in family affairs .  his new attitude further alienates his daughter , only reassuring her that her parents are nothing more than freaks of nature unjustly forced on her by the powers that be , and inspiring her to enter a relationship with her eccentric neighbor .  and the burnhams's neighbors provide american beauty with a significant chunk of its dramatic momentum .  ricky fitts ( wes bentley ) serves as the film's thematic center , providing the obscure , powerful meaning of the title .  colonel fitts , the father , is one of the most fascinating and complex characters in the movie , even considering his limited screentime .  kevin spacey has never been better , and this performance will certainly earn him a chance to put a little gold person on his mantel .  he never plays his droll character as a freak , rather , he effectively portrays him as a normal person led to drastic self-exploration by his dissatisfaction with life .  spacey is poignant and devastating in the role of a lifetime .  equally astonishing is young thora birch , who plays her potentially stereotypical rebellious teen character with suprising feeling and tenderness .  at two hours and ten minutes , american beauty didn't feel nearly long enough .  it's a complicated , unforgettable film that , like the ice storm two years ago , dares to explore the darkest reaches of suburban life .  powerfully and cynically , it dissects the notion of the pretty house with the white picket fence and appealing garden being the american dream .  it claims that this picture-perfect image is just that -- an image , and hiding behind it are lives much darker than common knowledge would have it .  the dark , deeply ironic ending , though given away by our narrator in the first few minutes of the movie , stays with you for weeks after it's all over .  american beauty is just the kind of uncompromising film hollywood needs every now and then to counterbalance the mindless drivel we see released ; even more so considering it's a masterpiece .

pos	the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire-fu copycats .  it's not a pretty death , and it's leaving the likes of schwartznager , stallone , and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea .  sometimes , the mix results in a mind-blowing spectacle unlike any other .  quality action with amazing and exciting stunt work , as in 1999's the matrix , can be a real gem .  but too often hollywood gets it wrong , even when they pay off chinese directors .  flying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists .  mostly it's laughable .  in hollywood's rush to emulate the success of the matrix , trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form .  but iron monkey , the latest asian import , shows us how to get it right .  iron monkey ( actually a reissue of a 1993 film ) is the story of a 19th chinese vigilante ( rongguang yu ) , fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the hungry .  but it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero wong fei-hong , most recently seen in one of the most overlooked , and possibly best films of 2000 , drunken master 2 ( released in the u . s . as the legend of drunken master ) .  unlike drunken master 2 , which stars jackie chan as an adult fei-hong , iron monkey finds a much younger fei-hong ( sze-man tsang ) and his father wong kei-ying ( yen chi dan ) thrust into the middle of iron monkey's fight against oppression .  iron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master 2 . at times , fighting styles , especially that of monkey himself , do devolve into the ridiculous twinkle-toed floating of films like crouching tiger , hidden dragon , director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back to earth .  iron monkey is at its heart a hardcore , kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger .  however , there are brief moments of profoundness shared between characters , such as those that pass between our outlaw hero and his good-hearted but misguided enemy , chief fox .  in those moments , and in others , iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of its audience .  while in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master 2 , iron monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune .  aka siunin wong fei-hung tsi titmalau .

neg	michael robbins' hardball is quite the cinematic achievement .  in about two hours , we get a glancing examination of ghetto life , a funeral with a heartfelt eulogy , speeches about never giving up , a cache of cute kids ( including a fat one with asthma ) , a hard-luck gambler who finds salvation in a good woman and a climactic " big game , " where the underdogs prove to have a bigger bite than anyone ever imagined .  all that's needed is a guy getting hit in the nuts and a food fight to have the first film solely based on cinematic clich ? s .  i can't wait to see the deleted scenes when it comes out on dvd .  obviously , hardball is a strikeout of a movie that never gets the bat anywhere near the ball .  it stars keanu reeves as the aforementioned gambler , who seems to owe every bookie in chicago an amount of money that rivals the gross national product of guam .  out of solutions , he begs his successful corporate friend ( the always welcome mike mcglone ) to lend him $5 , 000 .  instead , mcglone offers reeves the chance to help him coach a youth baseball team from the projects for a nice weekly stipend .  reeves , who wants to keep his fingers , accepts the offer , but discovers mcglone is only too happy to let him handle the team entirely .  the drowsy-voiced protagonist must teach the sassy inner city kids the baseball basics in a life of absentee parents and merciless gangs .  and maybe , just maybe , they'll play in the big championship game .  one of the glorious surprises in the screenplay by john gatins ( summer catch ) , adapted from daniel coyle's non-fiction book , is that there aren't any .  the movie coasts from heartfelt moment to heartfelt moment like a zombie .  that wouldn't be so bad , if the characters had an ounce of subtlety or humanity to them .  most of the kids' time is spent yelling at each other , talking in slang and acting surprised .  there's little that's naturally amusing about them , as they all seem to know the cameras are rolling .  the worst of the lot is a tough-talking younger player ( dewayne warren ) whose sole purpose , as the movie unfolds , is being an emotional pawn , a tactic so utterly despicable i can't find the right words to express myself .  the adults also don't fare well .  reeves is impressively uninspiring as the down-on-his-luck loser .  the character is poorly written , but reeves gives another charisma-free performance .  every time he speaks , he sounds like he just got up from a long nap and is gradually waking up .  kids are supposed to rally around this guy ?  diane lane , who co-stars as reeves' obligatory love interest , remains a glowing screen presence ( see my dog skip for better proof ) .  it's too bad that her role here consists of uttering lines like , " these kids trust you , and they don't trust anyone ! "  then there's d . b .  sweeney as an evil rival coach and john hawkes as reeves' scummy betting buddy and other unoriginal characters you've seen before and hope never to see again .  i wanted hardball to be good .  robbins' varsity blues was a funny and alternately taut tale of texas high school football that had ali larter smothered in whipped cream and jon voight sneering at everything that moved .  i haven't seen robbins' goofy ready to rumble in its entirety , but i am intrigued that " macho man " randy savage and martin landau can exist in the same movie without there being serious worldwide repercussions .  robbins obviously needs to go back to his forte -- making sports movies for guys and not cutesy , cuddly pap such as hardball , which also manages to annoy and insult the audience .  here's hoping that happens in the immediate future .  
pos	huppert and girardot give performances of exceptional honesty . 
pos	yes , i call this a perfect movie . not one boring second , a fantastic cast of mostly little known actresses and actors , a great array of characters who are all well defined and who all have understandable motives i could sympathize with , perfect lighting , crisp black and white photography , a fitting soundtrack , an intelligent and harmonious set design and a story that is engaging and works . it 's one of those prime quality pictures on which all the pride of hollywood should rest , the mark everyone should endeavor to reach . barbara stanwyck is simply stunning . there was nothing this actress could n't do , and she always went easy on the melodramatic side . no hysterical outbursts with this lady - i always thought she was a better actress than screen goddesses like bette davis or joan crawford , and this movie confirmed my opinion . always as tough as nails and at the same time conveying true sentiments . it is fair to add that she also got many good parts during her long career , and this one is by far the least interesting . the title fits this movie very well . it is about desires , human desires i think everyone can understand . actually , no one seems to be scheming in this movie , all characters act on impulse , everybody wants to be happy without hurting anybody else . the sad fact that this more often than not leads to complications makes for the dramatic content into which i will not go here . i liked what this movie has to say about youth , about maturing and about the necessity to compromise . the movie i associate most with this one is alfred hitchcock 's shadow of a doubt , it creates a similar atmosphere of idealized and at the same time caricatured small town america . the story has a certain similarity with fritz lang 's considerably harsher movie clash by night , made one year earlier , where stanywck stars in a similar part . i can also recommend it .

neg	plunkett & macleane marks the directing debut of jake scott , brother of ridley and tony .  naturally , this got me worried .  would jake's talent be inherited from ridley or tony ?  if it was from ridley , than the movie would be a thoughtful suspensor with action thrown in .  if it was from tony , it would be wham bang drivel .  unfortunately , the latter is true for this worthless picture with little charm .  carlyle and miller are the titular highwaymen , plunkett ( carlyle ) who is poor and unruly , and captain james macleane ( miller ) a clean cut gentleman .  as the tagline clearly wants to make known , they rob the rich and nothing else .  the film basically follows the rowdy hold ups the two stage , along with romantic interludes with lady rebecca ( tyler . )  hot on both their tails is mr chance ( ken stott ) who wants to see them both dead .  plunkett & macleane is an annoying little film that serves little purpose .  although undoubtedly slick and fast paced , there's very little merit contained in the film .  carlyle and miller are fun enough as the foul mouthed pair , although their characters are criminally undeveloped .  it appears that much of the money has been spent on the expensive looking sets and costumes , but not on the script .  the five ( ! ) screenwriters ( three credited ) have produced an still born movie : there's very little development in the story .  also , major events , such as mr . cash finding out who plunkett and macleane really are , are so rushed that they barely happened .  the story is a bit of a mess , frankly .  the performances aren't bad : carlyle and miller are typical lads , but liv tyler is a huge disappointment as the love interest .  her irritable , stilted performance sticks out like a sore thumb , and i was quite unsure on what accent she was trying to put on .  she looks nice , though .  more interesting is alan cummings as the campy lord rochester , and although his character amounts to nothing more than a two dimensional comedy gay character , he hams it up well .  ken stott is suitably evil as chance , but again he is nothing but a flat character .  i didn't particularly care when the predictable death sequence arrived .  although a disappointment in writing , and a minor success in acting , the film certainly look lavish , with good costumes , and wonderful sets .  but production design alone can't save a movie , especially a movie as bad as this mess .  jake scott would be more suited to directing a music video rather than this failed update of a period drama : the only update seems to be the fact that everyone must talk dirty , with 'f * ck this' and 'stand and f * cking deliver' splattered all over the place .  the mtv editing and direction are flash enough , but in the end decidedly empty .  plunkett & macleane is a massive disappointment .  although somewhat enjoyable during parts , it's so light it could float off the screen if it wasn't just images on a reel .  there's no thought , no development , no plot , just a series of manic edits and quirky camera angles to make this film appeal to gen-xers .  although it's a great idea : update a period drama to the mtv generation : it's execution is awful , and would more likely bore than excite .  sloppy and occasionally off puttingly tasteless , it's hard to recommend plunkett & macleane as a movie , but easy to recommend it as a overlong music video .  give it a miss .  
neg	a friend invites you to a movie .  this film would evade the explosions and special effects of standard summer fare , and be grounded in reality .  the plot is as follows : after a terrifying incident , a mother and her independent daughter separate from the father and move away from the city .  they need fresh air to get some perspective , maybe to start over .  romance begins to brew , however , as one of the locals , played by an international superstar in rugged clothing , sparks things up , ( especially at a country-western slow dance ) .  it stars a rising young starlet , helms a good cast , and is directed by one of the better actor-turned-directors in hollywood .  you accept .  you jump at the opportunity to see , what you believe to be , _the horse whisperer_ .  but , poor moviegoer , you have been conned .  alas , you find yourself watching , incredulously , _hope floats_ .  oh , woe .  your hope has sunk .  why was this movie made ?  why was it released ?  it is a travesty on nearly every level , and has the authority to sink the careers of nearly everyone involved .  at the hands of a better script , the film could have been a gem .  but it is clueless as to what it is about , and only succeeds in transferring same cluelessness to us poor viewers .  _hope floats_ stars sandra bullock as birdy , who , after discovering her husband has been cheating on her with her best friend ( on national television no less ) , takes her daughter and drives back to her home , helmed by a countryish bumpkin eccentric played by gena rowlands , ( she decorates with stuffed wildlife ) .  birdy's nephew , travis ( played by _leave it to beaver_'s cameron finley ) , is under her custody , and in one of the film's many failed in-jokes , is always seen wearing a different halloween costume .  what is the point of this ?  does it make any sense ?  is it supposed to be funny ?  the point of the film is to show that the family is eccentric , but i was convinced that the grandma should have been locked up for endangering the mental welfare of a child .  all of this undercuts the plot , of which there is none .  there are only many scenes that are supposed to register emotion .  there's the scene where birdy , who used to be the prom queen , is humbled by approaching a peer she once mocked , for a job .  there's the scene where birdy dances with her father , in the hospital for alzheimer's .  and then there's the sentimental scenes with justin , played by harry connick jr . , who is taking a liking to her again , showing her a beautiful pad that he built from scratch .  and during each of these scenes , i was sidetracked by my earlier question .  what sort of eccentric grandmother go through such great pains as to provide a dog costume , a kermit costume , a cowboy costume ( with whip ) , and a full furred barney costume for her grandson to wear during dinner ?  what sort of warped ramifications would this lead for the rest of his life ?  outside of this , there are other sure signs of screenwriters block .  when the daughter stands up to the bully at school .  when birdy almost loses her job .  when the family pulls in a goofy lip-synch to cheer someone up .  when someone dies .  when the daughter cries , ( no , wails ) in exasperation that her father is not coming back .  in a movie like this , you notice the strings being pushed , and you sit there , comatose , hoping it will end .  who can survive such a debacle ?  i worry for bullock's career , which has been running on auto-pilot for the last few years .  she has an attitude , a solid perkiness , and can drive a bus--but she can't handle the emotional scenes , much less hold a southern accent .  harry connick , jr . is worse--stick with singing , or get some acting lessons , please !  gena rowlands is the best part of the film .  but she's such a good actress , that it staggers the mind that she's weighed down by such lukewarm material here .  it would be a severe tragedy if the recurring star of john cassavettes' great films is known for this film .  two notes to forest whittaker : ( 1 ) cut the slow-motion sequences .  there are twelve times where you undercut your own direction by such a failed trick .  have you done so , you could have shaved off ten-minutes of this almost unbearable debacle .   ( 2 ) you've had to know something was wrong if your cinematographer's filter makes the candlelight appear like little " x " s .  you're not a bad director , but you can't change a terrible script .  there's a recurring scene where birdy , working at the neighborhood fotomat , finds the machine go wrong , and image after destroyed , warped , dark image appear .  think about it .  a succession of destroyed images may have been more entertaining than this movie .

pos	 " the blair witch project " was perhaps one of a kind , a unique film that played completely on its own merit , managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses .  its success made a sequel inevitable , but this is not the sequel , i suspect , anyone much wanted .  after the release of " the blair witch project " , tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville , in order to get a glimpse of the blair witch .  locals have turned this mass hysteria into a great business opportunity , selling twig-sculptures , stones and dirt like those in the movie , and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn , shouting , " get out of these woods and go home !  there is no goddamned blair witch ! " .  jeff ( ) is one of those people , who has used the sudden popularity of the small town to his advantage .  after he got released from the mental institution , he created a mobile business that attracts thousands of customers through the internet .  as the movie starts he is leading one of these groups into the woods , on the " blair witch hunt " .  among the five strangers is stephen and his girlfriend , the pregnant tristen , who are writing a book on the hysteria caused by the film called " the blair witch : history or hysteria ? " , and kim , who dresses in black and has some psychic powers .  the last member of the crew is erica , a young beautiful witch-wannabe , who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore , saying " the first rule of wicca is , do no harm , because whatever you do will come back to you threefold . "  this strange group plunges into the woods , where they begin to argue about their different approaches to the experience .  on the very first night that they decide to spend under the stars amidst the ruins of parr's abandoned house , strange things start happening .  when they wake up their equipment is gone and only the tapes remain .  after a while they discover strange markings on their bodies .  they are somehow lost in time , as it loops uncontrollably back and forth .  they are all haunted by hallucinations and horrible nightmares and soon they can not see the difference between dreams and reality .  the only thing that they are sure of is that they have brought something or someone with them from the woods . .  documentary director joe berlinger ( " paradice lost " ) helms " blair witch 2 " , leaving the creators of the first film ( dan myrick and ed sanches ) in the background .  the opening scenes--the documentary showing the townspeople affected by the first film-- is a more promising approach , because instead of trying to cover similar ground , it goes outside the first film and makes its own stand .  but soon the movie gets confused and sidetracked by its own story , that is never resolved and ends with a very anticlimaxic epilogue .  in a way , this is a typical hollywood sequel .  more money has been spent and more people have worked on a project that was doomed to fail .  the horror and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated .  of course in these situations , quantity is more important than quality and profit is more important than the artistical values .  from its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloody-red forest , with carter burwell's ( " being john malkovich " and " fargo " ) musical score in the background , you realize that with the exception of its title , this film has absolutely nothing to do with " the blair witch project " .   " blair witch . . "  was filmed by handheld videocameras and nfeatured acting that was mostly based on improvisation .  in the sequel the technical aspect of the film is close to perfection , creating a completely different atmosphere .  with its graceful cinematography , production design and flashy editing , the film has a very polished look , which is impossible to associate with the first installment .  and though berlinger directs his film with an energy and pace that makes the adrenaline rush through the body a couple of times , he has obviously misunderstood the nature of his predecessor .  the key is simplicity .   " blair witch project " had a story which was incredibly simple .  that allowed the audience to fill the gaps with our own imagination .  the film was practically an empty screen , on which we projected our most frightening nightmares .  the effect was incredibly powerful , lasting and entir e everyone , but in a different way .   " book of shadows " feels incredibly controlled and restrict .  here , very little is left to our imagination and the story is so complex and " clever " that the screenwriters are the first to get lost in it .  there is is no book of shadows and no conclusion that we can be satisfied with .  this is simply a less artistic film that doesn't have the talent and originality of its predecessor .  it resorts to fancy cinematography and special effects to create the right effect and doesn't always succeed .  but most importantly : it stands on its own ground and has almost no connection with the first movie , which doesn't allow it to destroy the original .  in the end , i can't call it a bad effort .  it's less artistic , not so scary and less original , but certainly not bad .  it's simply different .  in fact , if you haven't seen " the blair witch project " , you might like this film for what it is -- a cross between " the blair witch project " and the " scream " -films .  the only element that remains constant and similar between the two films is the solid acting ( jeffrey donovan and tristine skyler should be mentioned ) and incredible sense of surrealism .  but it's a common knowledge and experience that , with a few exceptions , every movie sequel is worse than the original and some are even not worth making .  to me the story of " the blair witch project " seemed completed , but there are obviously no limits to commercial success that " the book of shadows " is certainly assured .  and it's already time to look forward to " blair witch 3 " .

pos	three things i learned from " being john malkovich " : when getting on the elevator for your first day of work on the 7 1/2th floor of a building , always bring your crowbar ; don't stand in the way of your wife's actualization as a man ; and , whenever entering a portal into the mind of another human being , wear old clothes , because , hey , it's muddy in there .   " being john malkovich " is the most original film to come down the pike in a very long time .  wildly surrealistic , yet presented in a down-to-earth , funky style , this is the kind of movie that sticks in your head .  after savoring the sheer inventiveness of the storyline , you roll around the wealth of ideas contained within it .  from the ethics of relationships and politics of immortality to the very nature of identity itself , there's a lot to think about here .  just don't forget to have fun .  clearly , all parties involved in the making of the film certainly did , starting with writer charles kaufman .   " i wrote 'being john malkovich' without an outline , " he explains in the press notes , " blindly , with no sense of direction or purpose .  it's important to me that i don't have a map before i start .  this allows me to surprise myself , stay engaged , discover things , and , hopefully , allow the unconscious to surface . "  spike jonze ( mark wahlberg's na ? ve buddy in " three kings " ) takes it from there .  the white-hot director of the beastie boy's " sabotage , " an award-winning parody of '70s tv cop shows , as well as numerous other music videos and commercials , eschews typical mtv flash for his feature film debut .  jonze wisely realized that a storyline this unusual is most effectively presented in a low-key style .  his flat , matter-of-fact approach works perfectly .  and then there's the cast .  john cusack plays control freak craig schwartz , a street performer who periodically gets decked by parents objecting to his remarkably expressive , but decidedly erotic puppet shows .  over the years , his marriage to obsessive pet store employee lotte ( cameron diaz ) has devolved .  once passionate lovers , the two are now little more than courteous roommates .  financially strapped , craig takes a job as an entry-level file clerk at lestercorp , located on the 7 1/2th floor of a manhattan building .  navigating around dr . lester ( orson bean ) , his 105 year-old boss and floris ( mary kay place ) , lester's dotty secretary , craig tries to settle into his new position , but two things keep him distracted .  first , there's the beautiful and imperious maxine ( catherine keener ) , who delights in tormenting craig over his obvious lust for her .  and then there's the hole behind the file cabinet , which turns out to be a portal into the mind of actor john malkovich .  craig learns that anyone who enters the portal gets whooshed into the subconscious of malkovich , where they can experience life from his point of view ( with enough concentration , you can even influence his actions ) .  after 15 minutes , the visitor gets ejected and unceremoniously dumped in a ditch on the side of the new jersey turnpike .  then things get a little weird .  by the way , if you're concerned that i gave away too much of the plot , rest assured - - i barely scratched the surface .  one of the most satisfying aspects of the fable is that kaufman is not content to simply milk laughs from his bizarre set-up .  instead , he crawls into the dark premise as completely as craig crawls into malkovich , rummaging around and toying with the various philosophical implications of compromising another person's identity .  he also examines the consequences of the malko-visits to craig , lotte , maxine and , of course , john malkovich himself .  the performances are superb .  malkovich ( best known to mainstream audiences for his work in " dangerous liaisons , " " in the line of fire , " and as head psychopath in the guilty-pleasure " con air " ) tweaks his own image in a dandy self-deprecating turn .  far from his effete , vaguely reptilian persona , this malkovich is just another schlub , drinking with his pals and trying to get laid ( incidentally , charlie sheen also plays himself in a hilarious parody of his well-earned bad boy reputation ) .  as always , john cusack nails his part , handily pulling viewers along even as craig's actions become unconscionable .  the big surprises come from catherine keener and cameron diaz , both playing against type .  kenner , usually cast in icy subordinate roles , is terrific as a highly intelligent , extremely manipulative femme fatale .  cameron diaz , barely recognizable under a mess of brown , curly hair , sheds her perpetually sunny smile and draws big laughs as a woman thrown into extreme sexual confusion after taking a ride in malkovich .   " being john malkovich " stumbles towards the end , as jonze and kaufman try too hard to resolve the various subplots .  additional characters and increasingly complex explanations lead to a cluttered finale .  regardless , this contemporary " alice in wonderland " is a real treat .  i enjoyed watching " being john malkovich , " but only later , after reflecting on the film , did its resonance fully hit me .  at one point , craig says , " do you know what a metaphysical can of worms this portal is ? "  truer words were never spoken .

neg	this is a film that i was inclined to like at the outset : the two main characters had been involved with the fine television drama st .  elsewhere for several years , and i had understood that the director/screenwriter had written for the show on occasion also .  i am sorry to report that the results were not up to my expectations , nor were they satisfactory .  if i had to list a reason why . . . .  but that would be getting ahead of myself ; besides , it's not immediately clear , as there are so many problems with the film .  adam arkin plays a grade-school teacher who is sardonic , cynical , and somewhat abrasive , but a good teacher .  he spends his lunches playing basketball by himself on a nearby court .  one day , he meets a drifter ( david morse , who plays jack morrison on st .  elsewhere ) in the park , and inveigles him in a game of one-on-one basketball .  morse turns out to be good , and a friendship slowly develops between the two , as their respective professions progress on the screen--arkin's teaching , and morse's selling of paper flowers to passing motorists .  so far , my major complaint would be the lack of dialogue , and the constant intrusion of the musical soundtrack .  good music to be sure , but it doesn't replace the dialogue for setting the mood or telling the story--it makes the film somewhat minimalistic , a technique i rarely admire .  suddenly their friendship is interrupted by morse's introduction to a fellow teacher of arkin's , a woman arkin has long admired from afar , but it too reticent to approach .  it appears that she begins to admire morse ( who enjoys here attentions , but isn't sure what to do about it--she doesn't realize that he is a drifter , and knows nothing about his past ) , and this causes friction between arkin and almost everyone else .  until then , i had only a vague dissatisfaction with the film .  the conclusion is where it begins to evolve into a full-fledged failure .  the woman , at least to me , appeared to be fairly shallow ; i didn't realize how shallow until her final scene with arkin , where she reveals that she has been trying to make arkin jealous by her attentions to morse .  somehow , this is made to appear as if it is arkin's fault , and it is left with him feeling somehow victorious that he's gotten such a find of girlfriend .  frankly , dropping her on the spot would have seemed the most civilized action arkin could make ; punching her in the mouth not the least .  after this , the childish confrontation between morse and arkin at the end seems almost natural .  if i had to summarize a major gripe , it's that this is a story spread too thin , that creates semi-likable characters at the outset , and then suddenly jerks them into being 16-year-olds at the last moment .  it might be true-to-life with some people ; but that doesn't mean * i * have to like it .  i don't .   .  avoid .

pos	_in brief : _ this film needs no introduction .  if you haven't heard of it , then you must have been up in space on a sabbatical , and if you haven't seen it -- well , i suspect you're in a small minority !  first thing's first ? is it all it's hyped up to be ?  well , yes ? and no .  it's a good film , and there's a lot to like about it , but it's not without its problems .  when i saw the first trailer for " titanic " , it was when i went to see " bean " last summer , i think , my intial reaction was -- ain't that downright sick to make a disaster movie out of such a dreadful , real-life tragedy ? !  i mean , what's happened to hollywood's script-writers , have they run entirely out of new ideas ?  gads , whatever next , i asked myself , how about an action film based on hiroshima starring jean claude van damme ?  i was not entirely filled with anticipation , but then i wasn't alone in that respect .  it's when it came out in the cinema , to rave reviews ( well , mostly ) and anyone who'd been to see it seemed disturbingly obsessed by it that i started to take notice !  i didn't see the film until several months after its release ( by which time my sister had seen it about four times ! ) ,  so i went with a slightly more open mind , but i still didn't think i'd enjoy it much .  did i ? yes and no .  mainly yes , i'm happy to say .  the first hour or so was beautifully done , not so much because of the scripting ( i'll talk about that later ? ) but because the re-created ship and sets were stunning to look at , as was cameron's directing , and the performances of the principal cast were so strong that the " human " aspect of the story , the romance between rose ( kate winslet ) and jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , was enchanting .  the film is told via flashback , with gloria stuart playing the elderly rose in the modern day ( you knew that , a' course !   : - ) ) .  well , it's an often effective device to use in storytelling -- though sometimes it can fall flat .  does it work here ?  in script form it doesn't add all that much to the story .  what does add a lot to the story is gloria stuart , whose stunning performance is the strongest , most moving of the film .  her presence brings a much deeper level of passion , and depth to the story , and though her appearances are relatively brief , the film would have suffered without her .  also impressive are dicaprio and winslet , who wholly succeed in rising above the often poor dialogue , and the bond they form is both heartfelt and moving .  it's an old story , you know -- forbidden love ala romeo and juliet -- but it works , and jack's " rescuing " rose ( in both literal and figurative senses ) and teaching her to live life for what counts was pointed and touching .  in fact , i enjoyed the first half of the film a lot , largely because winslet and dicaprio bring such and charm , energy to the romance .  it's engaging , touching and very enjoyable .  there's more than a tinge of poignancy to it as well , simply because you know it's not going to be a happy ending .  which leads us to the second half of the film .  we all knew it was coming .  i'm sure director cameron was looking forward with eager anticipation to it , because as he's stated in interviews , the real thrust of the story ( for him ) was the sinking , and the jack/rose romance was a merely a manipulative plot device to get you emotionally into the film .  i think that understates the importance of the romance , as i found it far more enjoyable than an hour of watching people die .  the iceberg arrives , and the captain announces that titanic will have sunk in about an hour .  and it is an hour .  my goodness , we don't miss a second of that hour ?  gratuitous ? well , perhaps not by today's standards , i'm sure there's been far worse produced under the banner of " entertainment " in other films .  but i certainly wasn't prepared for how shocking and graphic the last hour or so would be .  not that i'd expect the word " understatement " to be part of cameron's vocabulary ( he who brought us such , umm , vivid films as " terminator 2 " and " aliens " ) .  is it overdone ?  i thought so .  understatement can sometimes work wonders in conveying tragedy .  no , no one expected a happy ending , but i didn't quite expect the horrendously shocking and powerful scenes we were bombarded throughout the film's second half .  still , whether it was overdone and heavy-handed or not , if it was the shock-factor cameron was after it worked , because i was shocked and moved , in fact i spent most of the last hour in tears !  you really couldn't help but get emotionally involved , whether it was wishing someone would knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance of rose's overboard or desperately hoping that rose would rescue jack , or that jack would rescue rose , or that they would both survive .  perhaps the most harrowing scene was when the ship has sunk , and those that sunk along with the ship freeze to death on the water surface .  the bit where rose lets go of jack's hand , while promising she'll never let go in her heart was particularly heart-wrenching , and the sight of rescue boats sailing amid the ocean of corpses was a pretty powerful image , to put no fine a point on it .  i loved the ending , however , which was both moving and slightly uplifting following the horror of the past hour and a half .  so , we've established that the film is powerful and moving , if the last hour was rather excessive .  haven't mentioned the script .  plot-wise it's ok , though the jack/rose relationship was beautifully developed , but i've a feeling that's to the actors credit if anything .  as for the dialogue ? well , titanic is set in 1912 .  it's a period drama .  but i saw very little indication of period in so far as the dialogue is concerned .  did they really use phrases like " goddamn it ! "  back in the turn of the century ?  i doubt it .  would someone talk like this : " do ya love the guy or what ? " .  i doubt it .  is such dialogue as " i saw the iceberg , and i see it in your eyes now " not just a bit ? clumsy ?  yes it is .  a little more attention to dialogue would not have gone astray , and cameron himself is to blame ( he wrote the script ) .  stick with directing , dude .  but its more than redeemed by the acting , with dicaprio and winslet on fine form , ably supported by a strong cast .  star of the show was gloria stuart , though -- why didn't she win that oscar ? !  after all , they were throwing oscars at " titanic " left , right and centre , but gloria was perhaps the most deserving nominee .  directing-wise cameron does a spectacular job .  like i said , his vision was a bit excessive , but at least he directed it well .  i haven't even mentioned james horner's beautiful score .  utterly heavenly , though when your dad and sister play the soundtrack a lot you do start to get a bit bored with it !   ; - )  i've finished my rant , which lasted a lot longer than i thought it would !  just leaves a couple of questions ; was it worth all those oscars ?  hell , don't talk to me about oscars .  bloomin' farce .  it was deserving in a number of departments , though .  last question ; is it , as some suggest , one of the best films of all-time ?  nope , i don't think so .  it's certainly one of the most powerful and memorable films i've ever seen , but i don't think it quite ranks as one of my all-time favourites .  and as for the fact they're reportedly making a " titanic 2 " ? well i guess that's typical hollywood for you !

neg	toward the bottom of the '80s action movie barrel lies action jackson , the only movie in hollywood history to show sharon stone and vanity topless within a span of ten minutes .  this carl " apollo creed " weathers vehicle features the traditional cop vs . evil establishment crook , and relies on all the '80s trappings , from the token heroin addict who needs a fix to the shouting superior officer .  somewhere in between come the explosions and boobs , although there is a curious lack of exploding boobs .  weathers is action jackson , a detroit cop known for all sorts of crazy vigilante techniques .  speaking of one past criminal apprehension , jackson's superior yells , " you tore his arm off ! "  jackson replies , " he had a spare . "  jackson has been busted down to a desk job because of past problems with auto manufacturer dellaplane ( craig t . nelson ) and now has to act as department liaison to a dinner honoring nelson .  after hearing what jackson thinks of him , stone says , " i take it you're not one of dellaplane's friends . "   " not unless they changed the definition , " jackson glowers .  and of course it turns out stone is mrs . dellaplane .  faux pas , jackson . . .  not everything is happy in motown ; people are being killed and dellaplane has evil plans for the awa .  it's all up to jackson to stop it , and his only lead lies in vanity ( not his own ) .  wherever she left off with prince in terms of exchanging sexual favors for career advancement she picks up in action jackson .  she plays the heroin addict and chanteuse in dellaplane's nightclub .  after singing one particularly sultry number for him , she saunters over and complains , " i expected a standing ovation . "  he responds , " you're getting one , " and it's damn clever because he's sitting down at the time .  prince wouldn't even let out an innuendo that lame and he's the king of the horndogs . . .  or at least the prince .  it's a testament to the '80s that sharon stone is killed off within the first 30 minutes but vanity survives the whole movie .  action jackson is another variation on the " unlikely partners " buddy action flick , with jackson lugging junkie vanity around .  this leads to some of the worst paired acting of the me decade , and with the dialogue they're given , there's not much room for improvement .  my favorite is when vanity , feeling the effects of drug withdrawal , says , " i feel like my teeth are hollow , my gums are made of dry rubber and someone's trying to start a bonfire in the back of my bloody head . "  jackson's response is , " i think i felt that way once .  they called it love . "  you'll understand when i say watch this at your own risk .  serving the world for nearly 1/25th of a century !

"  the plot begins when a man is eaten in half by the giant crocodile in black lake in maine .  that brings the local sheriff ( brendan gleeson ) and a fish-and-game warden ( bill pulman ) to investigate .  also , a paleontologist ( bridget fonda ) from new york is sent to look at a tooth and an eccentric millionaire/crocodile lover ( oliver platt ) flies in because he wants to swim beside the beast .  soon there is tension between everybody because half the people want to kill the croc and the other half want to save it .  there's also an eccentric old lady ( betty white ) who lives by the lake and has a few secrets .  as i mentioned before kelley and director steve minor ( h20 ) don't go for a serious approach towards the material but they also don't have anything sly or satirical or witty to say either .  the betty white character is completely unfunny and none of the other characters are really that interesting , they're all basically idiots .  if they had any brains the croc wouldn't have been that much of a challenge to catch and they wouldn't have put themselves in half of the situations that they did .  but then again , if they were smart there wouldn't be a movie .  basically , " lake placid " is best undiscovered .

( judging by the costuming at the end of the movie , the main accomplishment of this brave new world is in re-inventing polyester . )  when he's not pointing the camera directly at himself , director costner does have a nice visual sense , and it is undeniably fascinating to see such an unabashedly jingoistic film in the trust-no-one 90's ; but by the time the second hour rolled around , i was reduced to sitting on my hands to keep from clawing out my own eyes .  mark this one " return to sender " .  
neg	the marvelous british actor derek jacobi stars in writer and director john maybury's love is the devil about the popular modern artist francis bacon .  as always , jacobi's acting is impeccable , but the movie tries hard and succeeds at being unentertaining and opaque .  the movie convincingly argues that francis , played by jacobi , was a completely despicable and vain individual , but it never provides any insight into his work or any motivation for his attitude .  when interviewed by a fawning talk show host , francis calls his style " chance brushstrokes . "  starting with a burglary of francis's flat , the film uses loud sound effects that sound like they were lifted from a cheap horror movie .  the camera shots are heavy on the avant-garde angles -- lots of wide-angle close-ups and distorted shots filmed through colored-glass reflections .  the director is much more interested in filmmaking style than in the substance of the story with the result being a sterile examination of a lonely and vain man .  daniel craig , in a lifeless performance , plays the burglar and boxer , george dyer .  when francis lays eyes on him after the break-in , francis promises not to call the police if he'll stay for sex .  he stays for the entire movie but never respects the man with whom he shares a bed .  he thinks that francis's paintings have " no bloody use , " and the movie presents no counterargument .  writer maybury barely outlines francis's character , and george and the rest of the supporting cast remain a complete enigma .  we learn little of george other than francis's reason for liking him -- george's " amorality and innocence . "  francis's love of sadomasochism is shown early and often .   " boxing is such a marvelous aperitif for sex , " he reflects to george on the way to watch a boxing match .  as the fighter's head is sliced open with a heavy blow , the camera cuts to a gleeful francis whose own head is soaked by the flying blood .  francis appears to be in complete ecstasy .  another of francis's favorite activities is viewing old movies of atrocities .  as the carnage mounts , we witness an orgasmically happy francis in the audience .  in a film that tries obsessively to shock , one dream sequence portrays a family in a car accident .  francis's mind slowly examines every bloody limb of the mother , the father , and the boy .  sometimes the script throws us tidbits of francis's wisdom which illuminate little while merely sounding insightful .   ( " i'm optimistic by nature .  i'm optimistic about nothing . "   " loneliness is my only true companion . " )  we learn more details about francis's makeup techniques than about the man himself .  he prefers shoe polish for his hair and sink cleaning powder for his teeth .  full of metaphorical interpretations , the film's best scene occurs late one night when george has to get up to go to the bathroom .  mistaking francis's picture of a toilet for the genuine article , he urinates on it and then crawls back into bed contentedly .  like a parody of a bad art house movie , love is the devil has horrid characters filmed bizarrely and confusingly by a director who is much more interested in technique than storytelling .  by the end , the audience hasn't learned any more than it could have in a three-minute sketch .  love is the devil runs 1 : 30 .  the film is not rated but should be considered nc-17 for violence , profanity , graphic sex , nudity and sadomasochism and is unacceptable for most teenagers .

( minor spoilers ahead . hey , do you really care if a film of this quality is " spoiled ? " ) traci is a girl with a problem . psychology has developed names for it when a child develops a sexual crush on the opposite - sex parent . but this girl seems to have one for her same - sex one , and i do n't think there 's a term for that . it might be because her mother dana is played by rosanna arquette , whose cute overbite , neo - flowerchild sexuality and luscious figure makes me forgive her any number of bad movies or unsympathetic characters . here dana is not only clueless to her daughter 's conduct ; she seems to be competing for the gold medal in the olympic indulgent mother competition .   it 's possible that dana misses traci 's murderous streak because truth be told , traci seems to have the criminal skills of a hamster . it 's only because the script dictates so that she manages to pull off any kind of a body count . a particularly hilarious note in this movie is the character of carmen , a mexican maid who is described by dana as around so long she 's like one of the family although she dresses in what the director thought would say , " i just fell off the tomato truck from guadalajara . " carmen is so wise to traci 's scheming , she might also wear a sign saying , " hey , i 'm the next victim ! " sure enough , traci confronts carmen as carmen is making her way back from mass , and bops her with one of those slightly angled lug wrenches that car manufacturers put next to your spare as a bad joke . i rather suspect than in real life those things are as useless as a murder weapon as they are for changing a tire .   in another sequence , arquette wears a flimsy dress to a vineyard , under cloudy skies , talking to the owner . cut to her in another flimsy dress under sunny skies , talking to the owner 's brother . then cut to her wearing the first dress , in the first location , under cloudy skies - but it 's supposed to be later . you get the picture . we 're talking really bad directing . as for skin , do n't expect much , although traci does own a nice couple of bikinis .   for those looking for a trash wallow , 8 . for anybody else , 1/2 .

neg	i love sharks . and mutants . and explosions . theoretically , with those parameters in mind , hammerhead : shark frenzy should have been the best movie ever . it is not . the monster looks like a villain from power rangers , and has approximately the same range of rubbery movement . this might be okay if the makers were n't quite as proud of its design as they seem to be . that is to say , for a guy in a big rubber suit in an action / scifi / horror flick that could benefit from some mystery , the shark gets a lot of screen time . granted , it is usually shaky and erratic . i guess you 're supposed to assume that it 's so scary that even the camera guy freaks out . the camera goes to a person about to get eaten , the camera goes to the shark . the camera goes back to the person about to get eaten , only now they are screaming and armless . and so on . the costuming is bad , the acting is poor , and the special effects are sub - par , but the writing is by far the worst . things happen completely randomly so that more people can be eaten , or so something can explode . because let me tell you , the people who made this movie definitely went in with a more explosions = more better mindset . characters shoot cars and there is a massive explosion . they shoot helicopters , there is a massive explosion . barrels , rocks , trees , whatever , they all explode , so much so that the freaking shark even explodes at the end . speaking of which , i do n't care how crazy a person is , i find it hard to believe that anyone would think trying to make a giant half - person half - shark have sex with a woman in order to make freaky shark people babies is a good idea . that is , unless that person is the mad scientist in this movie . the bad thing is , the movie is so random ( and at times , boring ) that even its badness is not really enough to hold a person 's prolonged interest . it might be a good one to mst3 k with your friends , but past that , if you happen to catch this bad boy on , do yourself a favor and change the channel .

neg	the general's daughter is a heartless , absurd film , a movie so hopelessly dedicated to its inane plot that it forgets entirely about its own characters .  director simon west treats issues like rape and sexual fetish with ham-handed obscenity , creating a film that banks almost entirely on exploitation and offensive pseudo-depth .  what's worse is that the movie is haphazardly glued together by two characters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic -- the ridiculous story requires them to do unbelievable things in the interest of reaching a dark conclusion in a sudden rain storm .  john travolta finds himself in the middle of the mess , playing warrant officer paul brenner ; brenner is assigned to find the murderer and rape of captain elizabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) , daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) .  brenner is teamed up with ex-spouse sarah sunderland ( madeline stowe ) , and they check out all the suspects on the base , including elizabeth's mentor , colonel moore ( james woods ) .  soon , it becomes apparent that elizabeth was into kinky sexual stuff , but the question comes down to why -- and , of course , who .  ebert's law of the economy of characters can be applied here ; one interesting thing i noted is that not only are all the characters suspects at some point ( including the two protagonists ) , but almost all of them end up directly intertwined with the story .  perhaps i should have issued a spoiler alert before mentioning that , but it's painfully obvious from the beginning that everyone in the film is hiding something .  on a story level , the general's daughter is ineptly constructed .  the film , adapted by christopher bertolini and william goldman from nelson demille's novel ( which was apparently based on a true story ) , plods along to its conclusion , filling in the blanks with stale , unrealistic dialogue and " shocking " plot developments .  having not read the novel , it's difficult to determine if these problems are the fault of the adapters or the original author , but i suppose they all are guilty to some degree .  scene after scene stumbles with pointless insincerity ; minutes after finding the dead young woman , brenner and sunderland engage in sarcastic dialogue , which includes endless strings of forced lines .   ( sunderland actually asks brenner , " why was she killed ? "  to which i would have answered , " if i knew , then the movie would already be over . " )  only after we've spent twenty minutes or so with these characters do we learn that they have a sordid history together ; this angle , though apparently present to develop their characters , is never explored .  not that it really matters , since the characters consistently do ludicrous things for no other reason than to drive the plot .  in one scene , sunderland is attacked by a man in a mask .  she sees one of his rings , and she and brenner find the man later that day based on the ring .  instead of questioning him like as they would a real suspect , they take him to brenner's houseboat , beat him up , and pour hot coffee in his lap .  this scene really pushed me over the edge , not because it's gratuitous and mean-spirited , but because it illustrates the film's complete disregard for the characters and the audience .  it was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene , mostly because nothing they do comes as a surprise .  i realized that these constructs on screen aren't actually characters , but devices present only to serve the story .  this would have been bad enough without the west's need to hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape and sexual misconduct .  compelling films about sexual crimes don't spend a lot of time on rape flashbacks , and they certainly don't show as much skin and sweat as a typical pornographic picture .  these scenes are not the least bit powerful ; on the contrary , they're intended simply to provide the audience with the necessary resentment for the villain , whomever that may turn out to be .  in addition , the movie treats sexual fetishes -- and sadomasochism in particular -- as if it's a perversion of everything we know to be pure .  this standpoint is certainly allowed , but only in accompaniment with well-developed themes to back it up .  as it is , the film forgets that a lot of people have sexual fetishes , and that putting on a pair of handcuffs does not make a person insane .  perhaps the only positive elements in the general's daughter are a couple of the performances .  james woods has a few terrific scenes , and plays his role with sharp , witty subtlety .  i also liked james cromwell , mostly because he comes across as slightly sympathetic despite the obvious intent of west to make him villainous .  nonetheless , these performances are undermined entirely by the dreary , obligatory atmosphere and the senseless neglect of characterization .  the general's daughter is the worst kind of hollywood film -- it pretends to have a soul , to be of strict moral code , when in fact it has nothing more than a group of cardboard cut-outs force-feeding the audience a toxic landfill of plot contrivances and one-sided moral judgments .

pos	the happy bastard's quick movie review  me tarzan . . . you  happy viewer .  for a minute there , i thought i was going to be groaning over the release of disney's latest , another adaptation of a legend from the past .   ( remember the pathetic pocahontas ?  yikes ! )  but guess what- disney , a company that's been on a roll lately with animated films , strikes again with another wonderful tale that pleases the eyes as well as the inner kid in you .  the story is pretty basic- tarzan is left orphaned and a female gorilla who's lost her young adopts him into her group .  as he matures into a much older man , tarzan still wonders just why he's so much different from the clan , and then arrives a hunter , a professor , and the professor's lovely daughter , jane- who meets tarzan rather quickly after getting in trouble with a group of feisty babboons .  from there , tarzan faces tough choices- should he stay with the ones that he grew up with or go join his own kind in england ?  the voicework here is pretty top-level .  tony goldwyn is very convincing as the ape man ; minnie driver adds a delectable touch to the already-beautiful jane ; nigel hawthorne makes for a pretty nasty hunter voice ; rosie o' donnell keeps the laughs rolling as tarzan's best ape friend terk ; and wayne " newman " knight has his moments as a panicky elephant .  the movie is superb throughout , mixing a great script with incredible computer-assisted visuals .  when tarzan tree-surfs ( a twist that was added on top of the same ol' vine swinging- and a great one , i might add ) , the camera twists and turns , allowing the trees all around to come to life vividly .  i couldn't believe my eyes- disney has come a long way since starting in a ballroom for beauty and the beast .  and the music's not half bad , either .  fortunately , there's no ridiculous singing characters here , just a great set of songs by phil collins that perfectly fit the mood .  there's some great action sequences here as well , including a wonderfully done chase between tarzan , jane , and the aforementioned babboons .  but , of course , it's not all action- there's a message here as well that has to do with family .  this is easily one of disney's best animated films of the decade and it's one i can't wait to put in my home library . . . that  is , if my vcr still works in the year 2000 .

neg	capsule : the running gag pair of characters from all of kevin smith's films gets their own movie .  the gags are sporadically funny .  it is more than occasionally funny for teens who are fond of scatological humor and anti-gay jokes .  the plot is weak and the leads are not a particularly funny comic team .  the little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith films are the best features of the film .  sadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the film worth watching .  this feels like the high school skit that that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night .   ( and it turns out he had very good reasons . )   , low 0 ( -4 to +4 )  a film needs a plot .  it needs characters for empathy value .  it needs a story and an emotional center .  if a film is just a chain of jokes it can only be so good and any entertainment value will succeed or fail based on how funny the jokes are .  kevin smith has now made two satisfying films , clerks and chasing amy .  with dogma he tried to make a philosophical religious comedy and mixed with a madcap romp .  peter cook and dudley moore did that very successfully with their bedazzled .  but getting the combination to work is very hard to do right and kevin smith's fecal monsters in dogma were not the way to do it .  his remaining two films , mallrats and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aimed squarely at a teenage audience .  jay and silent bob strike back is a compendium of gay jokes , penis jokes , flatulence jokes , film pastiches , and in-jokes .  how funny the jokes are will be a subjective call .  for me , the vast majority of the jokes were just not very funny .  there was not enough cleverness or variety .  it is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay .  penis jokes work only so many times .  showing up as minor characters in every kevin smith film jay and silent bob were a clever pair of human running gags .  they were sort of the modern equivalents of naunton wayne and basil radford , the comic duo who showed up satirizing the english middle class in several good british post-war films including dead of night , the lady vanishes , and passport to pimlico .  jay and silent bob were originally supposedly typical generation x stoners .  as the series wore on they had larger and larger parts .  in jay and silent bob strike back they are the leads .  jay and silent bob ( played by jason mewes and kevin smith ) are chased away from the front of the convenience store where they were dealing drugs in clerks .  this leaves them at loose ends .  they are not sure what would be worthwhile to do with their lives when they hear that a comic book with characters visually modeled on them will be adapted into a movie .  they decide to devote their lives to wrecking the movie or getting some of that big movie industry cash .  so it is off to hollywood to shake down the movie company and having adventures along the way .  the film is mostly about their adventures on the road and when they get to hollywood  the problem with this comedy team is that neither really pulls his weight to make the film funny .  silent bob , being silent , can only contribute to the comedy by reacting with that very expressive face of his .  this makes his piece of the comedy even less than a straight man like a dean martin or bud abbott would have .  jay has to be the comic .  he could carry the load for both if he were extremely inventive .  the problem is that he is not sufficiently funny .  he is too bland to be the comic half and his lines just do not show any comic flair .  so jay and silent bob are a long way from being a successful comic team .  their starring roles and the low humor make this a comedy for those young at mind and for people who can laugh at gags they have seen before--sometimes just minutes before .  like dogma before it , but definitely not like chasing amy , this film feels more like an amateurish skit than a real movie .  certainly neither the plot nor the characters are at all involving .  they are excuses for gags , many of which still fall flat .  it is dogma without any of the humorous theological content .  the film does not offer much to an adult audience .  i rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .

pos	the grandfather of italian horror the late mario bava has credits in nearly 100 films and tv movies produced in italy between 1939 and his death in the early 80's .  more practiced as a cinematographer than a director , bava nonetheless sat in the director's chair for beyond the door ii , the project which turned out to be his last full-length feature film .  alongside the appalling zombie schlock of hacks like lucio fulci , beyond the door ii is simply a revelation .  in his day bava was considered by most to be no great filmmaker , yet here he fashioned one of the finest italian horror movies of the 1970's .   ( note that the film has no connection with the 1975 exorcist-rip off behind the door , but for some unexplained reason was given this related title for release in the usa and australia . )  this story focuses on dora , a women set upon by a malevolent spirit that channels itself through her young son marco .  the film opens with dora , her son and second husband bruno returning to a house by the sea that was the scene of her first husband's suicide and her subsequent trauma 7 years earlier .  they hope to put the past behind them , but as small accidents start to befall dora - usually while bruno is away on business - she starts to suspect that marco ( played with uncanny ability by 8 year old david colin jr . ) is somehow involved in the strange goings on .  to reveal any more of the story would be unfair .  suffice to say that this artfully paced study of a woman suffering a nervous breakdown offers an intriguing plot , loads of atmosphere and solid acting , though the dialogue is somewhat weakened by the dubbing into english .  bava coaches a surprisingly good performance from the usually wooden daria nicolodi , wife of famed italian horror director dario argento .  her character is invested with sufficient depth to allow the audience real empathy with dora's troubled soul .  the music by italian ensemble libra is also effective , mixing odd-sounding 70's rock with classic gothic piano sequences .  and there is at least one moment - brilliantly engineered by bava - that is guaranteed to lift you ten feet out of your chair .  yet for italian horror , the bloodletting here is surprisingly minimal .  lamberto bava and francesco barbieri's script is more concerned with deeper , psychological terrors , with themes of guilt and suffering , with the notion that what we sow will shall - somewhere , somehow - eventually reap .  scholars of the genre take note : beyond the door ii is stylish , chilling , and essential .

pos	robert benton has assembled a stellar , mature cast for his latest feature , twilight , a film noir mystery set amid the fading stars of hollywood .  paul newman stars as retired detective harry ross .  harry has spent the last couple of years doing odd jobs for jack and catherine ames ( gene hackman and susan sarandon ) , a pair of married actors who have fallen from the limelight .  when jack sends him on a routine delivery job , however , the old instincts kick in .  soon , harry is wading through a mystery where friendships and lives are on the line , and he no longer knows who to trust .  there are plenty of familiar faces throughout twilight , in addition to newman , hackman and sarandon .  james garner plays raymond hope , a former cop and one of harry's best friends .  stockard channing plays verna , harry's former partner , and possibly a former love interest .  reese witherspoon is mel , the distrustful daughter of the ames' , and liev schrieber is her scuzzy boyfriend .  giancarlo esposito appears as harry's bumbling detective protigi , and john spencer is a suspicious police captain .  with a cast like that , it's almost worth watching twilight just to stargaze .  luckily , there's more to the film than some sort of actor's recognition ceremony .  twilight has a solid film noir-ish plot .  it may not have as many twists and turns as some of the classics , but it has much more than a lot of what passes for film these days .  the major cast members all deliver strong performances , as can be expected of their caliber .  however , none of them have that little extra oomph which would make them memorable .  the supporting cast is enjoyable , if a little underdrawn .  stockard channing's character , in particular , is a cipher .  there's more to her character than the film takes the time to describe .  it's a minor , but irritating , flaw .  with a solid cast , and a good plot , there's a lot to recommend about twilight .  it's biggest flaw is actually its short running time .  at a slim 94 minutes , there's a lot of stuff that's packed into an awfully small package .  still , the chance to see newman , sarandon and hackman working together is worth a cramp or two .

pos	the farrelly brothers' third film , after dumb and dumber ( 7 . 5/10 ) and kingpin ( 8/10 ) , brings together the real-life couple of cameron diaz and matt dillon , some nasty humour , a cute dog , and a mix of love , fate and romance .  plot : high-school nerd ted gets lucky when the cutest girl in his class asks him to the prom .  unfortunately for ted , he accidentally gets a part of his male anatomy ( ouch ! )  caught in his zipper , and misses the big night .  thirteen years later , ted still can't get mary out of his mind , and hires a private detective ( dillon ) to find her .  once found , it turns out that mary has more than one suitor , and that's when the real fun begins .  critique : likeable comedy with a few extremely funny scenes , some funny looking people , and a plot that won't ever put you to sleep .  having said that , i must admit that i did like the farrellys' two previous films more than this one , but that is saying a lot , since i really did love those earlier pics .  this one is also quite funny , but it didn't really blow me away like the others .  then again , maybe my expectations were too high .  then again , maybe i should shut up , and write a little more about the film , and less about my supposed subconscious reasons for liking/disliking the film .  continuing where their other pictures left off , the farrellys' create a cutesy world of people with strange and endearing qualities , and a simple plot by which to tie them all together .  this one also includes plenty of toilet humour , but also some borderline fun-making of the disabled and mentally-challenged .  i must admit that i really wasn't sure whether to laugh at some points or not .  not a good place to be .  having said that , the scenes that did tear through the audience , and yours truly , were extremely hilarious , and went on for several minutes after the punchline .  the laughter practically killed out the next scene for one of the best ones in the movie ( something to do with hair gel ) .  on the negative end , i did not like the musical interludes of jonathan richman that ran through the entire picture .  i found them quite useless , unfunny and distracting .  also , i found that a lot of the funnier scenes had already been shown in the film's trailer .  and of course , i never quite buy the fact that these beautiful , intelligent , single women still can't seem to find the " right guy " ( see kiss the girls ( 7/10 ) .  i did really like all of the actors in the film , especially ben stiller , who appears to be solidifying his mark as a great comical actor with this picture and one of my favourites from 1996 , flirting with disaster ( 8/10 ) .  i also liked matt dillon with his big teeth , and lee evans with his superb faux-sympathy british accent .  funny stuff .  also , make sure that you stay for the credits , because there is an entire montage of outtakes from the film that plays under a lip-synched version of " build me up buttercup " , which is really cool .  overall , a cute comedy with a decent premise , and a few particularly hilarious scenes .  little known facts : the farrellys big break came when they somehow got a copy of their script " dust to dust " into the hands of eddie murphy via ? murphy's neighbour .  they only found out about murphy's interest , when they saw eddie mention the script on the david letterman show one night .  matt dillon is a high school dropout .  in between acting gigs , dillon has branched out into the restaurant business .  close to home in his native new york , he co-owns both a bar called the whiskey and a swanky uptown eatery called the falls .  cameron diaz stands 5 " 9 , started working as a model at the early age of 16 , and loves cats .  ben stiller's father is jerry stiller .  he played george costanza's ( jason alexander ) father on tv's " seinfeld " .  peter farrelly has written a novel entitled " outside providence " which is currently being filmed starring alec baldwin .  rob moran , who plays the cop in this film , also played the millionaire bowler in kingpin , and the bartender in dumb and dumber .  he is old friends with the farrelly brothers from college , and is currently married to entertainment tonight anchor/correspondant julie moran .  harland williams , who plays the nutty hitchhiker in this film , also played a state trooper in the farrelly's earlier dumb and dumber , and was the star of the unfortunate rocket man .

pos	kids - of whatever age - do not want to know about their parents ' sex lives . and grown - up children are often seriously baffled and disconcerted by any evidence that aging parents possess an active libido . lastly , many moviegoers are very uncomfortable watching a dowdy , frumpy widow who would pass unnoticed almost anywhere discover her aching capacity and need for raw passion with a handsome man half her age . " the mother " is a provocative look at a scarcely filmed reality - a woman who is n't ready to stay home , watch " the telly , " and vegetate after her husband of nearly three decades , and a controlling , dominating chap at that , packs it in with a massive heart attack . may ( anne reid ) and her husband have two children , each dysfunctional in his or her own way . the male son lives with a beautiful wife who may well be driving him to the bankruptcy court with her extravagant commercial venture . paula ( cathryn bradshaw ) , is a teacher with aspirations of succeeding as a writer . she 's attractive , not pretty , and she seems to have a close relationship with mum - at first . back at her house after burying her husband , may determines to not stay there . rejecting typical widowhood with its legacy of boring days and no adventure , she goes to stay with paula who has a young son . paula 's boyfriend , darren ( daniel craig ) , is a ruggedly handsome contractor who seems to be taking an awfully long time to complete an addition to may 's son 's house . may is quite taken with hard - drinking , coke - sniffing darren whose treatment of paula ought to have alerted may that he was , for sure , a fellow of the royal academy of cads . what follows is a torrid affair between darren and the besotted and now bubblingly alive ( dare i say reborn ? ) widow . the love scenes are graphic but take second place to amateur artist may 's pen and ink sketches of their trysts which then play a role in the enfolding drama ( or debacle , take your pick ) . the theater in manhattan was packed for today 's early afternoon showing with well over half the audience in the range of may 's age . that some were shocked or disturbed to see her disporting herself with erotic abandon in the arms of a much younger man is an understatement .   this blindingly honest look at an older woman 's awakened passion after decades of dutifully obeying her husband 's desire that she stay at home and raise kids ( she also mentions he did n't like her to have friends - what a guy ) surfaces a number of issues . while may 's dalliance with darren does n't constitute incest , there are real psychological dimensions , and issues , with a mother bedding her daughter 's lover . and paula is n't made of the stoutest stuff to begin with . the affair , once disclosed , allows the peeling open of the mother - daughter relationship which , from paula 's viewpoint , left something to be desired . ms. bradshaw is excellent in the role of a daughter who wants her mother 's support as well as her love - she has n't been dealt a terrible hand by life but it is n't a bed of roses either . may is strong in her resolve to both acknowledge her sexuality and expect , indeed demand , a future of happiness . but she is also inescapably vulnerable . she 's fishing in uncharted emotional waters . who controls her relationship with darren and why are difficult issues for her to understand , much less resolve . in her sixties , she 's still a work in progress . " something 's got ta give " recently showcased mature sexuality but in an amusingly antiseptic way assuring no viewer would be discomfited . after all it 's jack nicholson and the always beautiful diane keaton cavorting in the world of the rich . and to insure that no serious psycho - social issues were explored , keaton 's young girlfriend , amanda peet , daughter of keaton , not only blesses the match but insures that the audience knows she and her old(er ) would - be lover never hopped into the sack . no easy out here . anne reid 's inspired performance forces discomfort on some while drawing respect from others . her naked body bursts with sexuality for some and appears absurd as an object of physical attraction to others ( the comments of audience members leaving today reflected all these views ) . kudos to director roger michell for tackling a fascinating story with verve and empathy . 9/10 .

neg	did i do something bad ?  i must have , because sitting through this movie was sheer punishment .  here's the plot .  ricky ( jeff goldblum ) is producer of the good-buy network , one of those 24-hour home shopping channels .  the new boss ( robert loggia ) plans to can ricky's behind if he doesn't turn the previous months' flat sales numbers around , and to add to his problems , ricky also has to work with kate ( kelly preston ) , the ivy league wunderkind whom the boss has brought with him .  kate and ricky don't get along and don't have any great ideas until they meet g ( eddie murphy ) , a spiritualist who sees something positive in everything .  his soothing voice and simple logic makes people feel good , and it's this quality that will make g the new gbn television star and the key to the network's success .  the first problem is a flaw in the plot .  sure , g makes people feel good .  sure , we're told that most people feel guilty after buying an impulse item , no matter how wealthy they might be , and i'll even believe that g talks a talk that allows people to feel good about what they've bought .  but , hey , that's after they've bought it .  why do sales skyrocket the first time g is on camera ?  far from trying to sell the product , g instead blathers on about how you don't even need the thing .  someone please tell me how this is supposed to move merchandise in the first place .  you might say that people feel good about what they've bought , so they come back and by more , but due to the simple fact that the first round of sales in inexplicable , i'm not convinced this is what the filmmakers had in mind .  the whole movie is therefore seriously undermined because the key point in the plot is never credible .  another problem is in the humor .  you know , if you see that eddie murphy is in a movie , i think it is not unreasonable for you to expect that the film is a comedy .  whoa , partner , are you in for a surprise .  holy man is not funny .  murphy , the one asset you'd think this movie has ( remember how they brought him in at the last minute to save best defense ?  - then again , maybe you don't ) is seriously reigned in .  the script gives him almost nothing to work with , and it seems as though director stephen herek kept him toned down so that the other actors in the film wouldn't be left as window dressing .  there's only one moment in the film where murphy is allowed to let loose , and it lasts for three shouted words , which seem totally out of place as a result .  pathetic .  in all , there are about three jokes that work in the entire picture , and they're not even that great .  as a side note , there are some cameo appearances such as dan marino pitching a contraption which allows you to cook off of your car engine , and james brown introducing a medic-alert device that shouts " help me ! "  just like the hardest working man in show business at the push of a button , but these never cause your personal laugh-o-meter to rise above the level of mild bemusement .   " well , " you ask , " surely there must be some convincing performances to make up for the lack of humor . "  think again , buckwheat .  jeff goldblum disappoints .  kelly preston is flat ( but not like that ) .  robert loggia , in the kind of role for which he has been virtually typecast , can't do anything with it .  the script is part of the problem , but these actors don't even look like they believe in the move they're making .  they look a lot like they're bored .  just like the audience .  so what do you have when the humor is absent from your comedy , and the acting is like the siberian steppes ?  a film that drags more than a dropped anchor .  but wait !  as if these problems don't make the film slow enough , the screenplay's pacing makes the movie even slower !  it takes the entire first half hour to establish the movie's premise , then more time as the film wades through a tortuous ( and seemingly mandatory ) romance between ricky and kate , and a sub-plot involving a conniving pr man ( eric mccormack ) who wants to discredit g and take over ricky's job as producer .  when the pr guy's plan is foiled , the film is climaxes , we're treated to that little epilogue , and then we can all go home , right ?  wrong .  the movie goes on for another half hour !  continental drift is the indy 500 compared to the pace of holy man !  the only thing holy about holy man will surely be the number of people exclaiming " holy ! @#% that movie was awful ! "  this one is for the truly pious .

 it's funny ! ) for stuart little and five other columbia tristar releases : the adventures of elmo in grouchland , madeline , the nuttiest nutcracker , muppets from space , and baby geniuses ( the only bad thing about this entire dvd . . .  i did not want to be reminded of the awfulness that is baby geniuses ) .  dvd-rom features are also on the disc , including web links and a demo of the stuart little cd-rom game .  but wait . . .  there's still more !  there's a section called " basement treasures " where you will find the auditions of the film's animators , six deleted scenes which you can select to view with or without commentary from the director , a visual effects gag reel , a production gag reel , and an incredible eight minute storyboard sequence detailing the original concept for the boat race scene ( with commentary from the director ) .  the first commentary track features director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson .  they give insightful and detailed thoughts about the film's production .  minkoff likes to point out scenes where other screenwriters came in and polished up the script , namely writers like scott alexander and larry karaszewski ( who wrote the people vs . larry flynt and ed wood ) and lowell ganz and babaloo mandel ( who wrote splash and multiplicity , among others ) .  anderson is very appreciative of the animators who worked with him and often points out which animator worked on each scene as they occur .  the second commentary track features visual effects supervisors john dykstra and jerome chen who discuss more specific details of the effects in the film .  movie fans will enjoy the informative first commentary track , serious animation buffs will love the second one .  now i know this is slightly off topic , but it is related specifically to this dvd so i must voice this now .  one of the music videos on the disc is for a song called " i need to know " by a group called r angels .  this video features four mid-teenage girls ( the singers obviously ) having a slumber party .  the girls ask a ouija board " i need to know . . .  who to do , who to do , who to do " as the song begins .  they then sneak out of their house , and along the way they strike a pose and their slumber party pajamas are magically transformed into middle class streetwalker outfits .  then they head to a party and dance suggestively with the guys while singing lyrics like " i'll be your pleasure all the time . . .  just say the words that you'll be mine " .  um . . .  what the hell ?  what does this have to do with stuart little ?  how is this in any way a song suitable for a kids movie , let alone a video suitable for a kids movie on dvd ?  when the video concludes , the words " to be continued " appear .  oh i can't wait to see who they've slept with when the toy story 2 dvd comes out .  kids won't care about most of the special features on this dvd , but those of us who can sometimes be turned into a " kid at heart " thanks to a winning family film sure appreciate them .  this is the way to do dvd , a good movie loaded with great features at a reasonable cost .  the di$ney people could learn a lot from columbia tristar .
